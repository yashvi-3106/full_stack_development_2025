## 29.Write a program to find all pairs in an array whose sum is equal to a given number.: Example 1:  Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 , Output: [0,1].



### **Approach 1: Brute Force (Using Nested Loops)**

In this approach, we will use two nested loops to check every possible pair of numbers in the array and check if their sum equals the target.

### **Code Implementation for Brute Force Approach (Without Vectors):**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to find all pairs whose sum is equal to the target using brute force
void findPairsBruteForce(int nums[], int n, int target) {
    bool foundPair = false; // Flag to check if we found any pair

    // Iterate over all pairs using two loops
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            // Check if the sum of the pair equals the target
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                // Output the indices of the pair
                cout << "[" << i << ", " << j << "]" << endl;
                foundPair = true;
            }
        }
    }

    // If no pair was found, print a message
    if (!foundPair) {
        cout << "No pairs found!" << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    int nums[] = {2, 7, 11, 15}; // Input array
    int n = sizeof(nums) / sizeof(nums[0]); // Length of the array
    int target = 9; // Target sum

    // Call the function to find pairs
    cout << "Pairs with sum " << target << ":" << endl;
    findPairsBruteForce(nums, n, target);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Brute Force Approach:**
1. **Nested Loops:** The outer loop iterates through each element, and the inner loop checks each subsequent element.
2. **Sum Check:** For each pair of elements, we check if their sum equals the target. If so, we print their indices.
3. **Flagging No Pairs:** If no pairs are found, we print a message.

### **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n^2)**. We have two nested loops, and for each element, we check every other element.
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)**. No extra space is required other than the input array.

### **Approach 2: Optimized (Using a Hash Map)**

In this approach, we can use a hash map (implemented using a simple array or manual hash technique) to track the difference between the target and the current number. This will allow us to check if the complement of the current number exists in the array.

However, since we are not using `vectors` or advanced data structures, we will implement this manually using an additional array to store the numbers we have seen so far.

### **Code Implementation for Hash Map Approach:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to find all pairs whose sum is equal to the target using hash map approach
void findPairsHashMap(int nums[], int n, int target) {
    bool foundPair = false;
    bool seen[1000] = {false}; // Array to track numbers we've seen, assuming array elements are in a reasonable range

    // Iterate through the array
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i]; // Calculate the complement

        // Check if the complement is already in the "seen" array
        if (complement >= 0 && complement < 1000 && seen[complement]) {
            // Output the pair of indices (complement, current element)
            cout << "[" << complement << ", " << nums[i] << "]" << endl;
            foundPair = true;
        }

        // Mark the current number as seen
        if (nums[i] >= 0 && nums[i] < 1000) {
            seen[nums[i]] = true;
        }
    }

    // If no pair was found, print a message
    if (!foundPair) {
        cout << "No pairs found!" << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    int nums[] = {2, 7, 11, 15}; // Input array
    int n = sizeof(nums) / sizeof(nums[0]); // Length of the array
    int target = 9; // Target sum

    // Call the function to find pairs
    cout << "Pairs with sum " << target << ":" << endl;
    findPairsHashMap(nums, n, target);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Hash Map Approach:**
1. **Array for Tracking Seen Numbers:** We use a simple array (`seen[]`) to track the numbers we have encountered while iterating through the array.
2. **Complement Check:** For each number in the array, we calculate the complement (i.e., `target - nums[i]`). If the complement is found in the `seen[]` array, we print the pair.
3. **Marking Numbers as Seen:** Each time we encounter a number, we mark it as "seen" by setting its corresponding index in the `seen[]` array.

### **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**. We only iterate over the array once, and checking the `seen[]` array is an O(1) operation.
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)** (if we don't count the space used for the `seen[]` array, which is of fixed size). The space used is constant, as we only store the numbers we've seen.

### **Summary of Approaches (Without Vectors):**

| Approach                      | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Advantages                      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Brute Force (Nested Loops)** | O(n^2)          | O(1)             | Simple and easy to understand.  |
| **Hash Map (Manual Approach)** | O(n)            | O(1)             | Efficient but requires extra array (`seen[]`). |

### **Conclusion:**
- **Brute Force** is easy to implement but not efficient for large arrays due to its quadratic time complexity.
- **Hash Map (Manual Approach)** is more efficient with linear time complexity, but it requires additional space to track the seen numbers.

For beginner students, starting with the brute force approach is good for understanding the concept, and once they are comfortable, they can move on to the optimized hash map approach.
