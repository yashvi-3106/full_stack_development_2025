## **Protected Members and Access in Inheritance**  

### **What Are Protected Members?**  
In C++, a class can have **private, protected, and public** access specifiers that determine how its members (variables and functions) can be accessed.  

- **Private Members:** Can only be accessed inside the same class (not in derived classes).  
- **Protected Members:** Behave like private members **inside the class** but can be accessed in derived classes.  
- **Public Members:** Can be accessed from anywhere.  

### **Why Use Protected Members?**  
Protected members are useful when you want to allow **child classes** to inherit and modify a member but keep it hidden from direct access outside the class.  

For example, suppose we are designing a **student database system** in CodingGita's BTech program. We don’t want students to access their **internal scores directly**, but faculty should be able to modify them.  

### **Example: Access Control Using Protected Members**  

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
protected:  // Protected member
    int marks;

public:
    void setMarks(int m) {
        marks = m;
    }
};

class Topper : public Student {
public:
    void showMarks() {
        cout << "Marks: " << marks << endl; // Allowed since marks is protected
    }
};

int main() {
    Topper obj;
    obj.setMarks(95);
    obj.showMarks();

    // obj.marks = 100;  //  Error! Can't access protected members directly
    return 0;
}
```

### **Output:**  
```
Marks: 95
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `marks` variable is **protected**, so it **cannot be accessed directly** in `main()`.  
- However, the **derived class `Topper` can access `marks`** inside its method `showMarks()`.

## **Inheritance and Protected Access Modifiers**  
### **How Different Inheritance Modes Affect Protected Members?**  
The behavior of **protected** members changes based on how the class is inherited:  

| Inheritance Mode | Protected Members Become |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Public Inheritance** | **Protected** in derived class |
| **Protected Inheritance** | **Protected** in derived class |
| **Private Inheritance** | **Private** in derived class |

### **Example: How Inheritance Modes Affect Protected Members**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
protected:
    int value = 10;
};

// Public Inheritance
class PublicDerived : public Base {
public:
    void showValue() {
        cout << "Public Inheritance: " << value << endl;  // Accessible
    }
};

// Protected Inheritance
class ProtectedDerived : protected Base {
public:
    void showValue() {
        cout << "Protected Inheritance: " << value << endl;  // Accessible
    }
};

// Private Inheritance
class PrivateDerived : private Base {
public:
    void showValue() {
        cout << "Private Inheritance: " << value << endl;  // Accessible
    }
};

int main() {
    PublicDerived pubObj;
    pubObj.showValue();
    // pubObj.value = 20; //  Error: Still protected, cannot access directly

    ProtectedDerived protObj;
    protObj.showValue();
    // protObj.value = 20; // Error: Cannot access

    PrivateDerived privObj;
    privObj.showValue();
    // privObj.value = 20; // Error: Cannot access

    return 0;
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Public Inheritance: 10
Protected Inheritance: 10
Private Inheritance: 10
```

**Key Observations:**  
- **Public Inheritance:** The protected member remains **protected** in the derived class but accessible inside it.  
- **Protected Inheritance:** The protected member **remains protected** in the derived class, and access is only available inside derived classes.  
- **Private Inheritance:** The protected member **becomes private** in the derived class and is **not accessible** in further derived classes.

## **Using Protected Members in a Real-World Scenario**  
Let’s say CodingGita is building a **university system** where **faculty can modify student data, but students should not modify their own data**.  

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base Class: Student
class Student {
protected:
    string name;
    int rollNo;
    int marks;

public:
    Student(string n, int r, int m) : name(n), rollNo(r), marks(m) {}

    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Roll No: " << rollNo << endl;
    }
};

// Derived Class: Faculty (can modify marks)
class Faculty : public Student {
public:
    Faculty(string n, int r, int m) : Student(n, r, m) {}

    void updateMarks(int newMarks) {
        marks = newMarks;
        cout << "Marks updated to: " << marks << endl;
    }
};

// Derived Class: StudentAccess (cannot modify marks)
class StudentAccess : public Student {
public:
    StudentAccess(string n, int r, int m) : Student(n, r, m) {}

    void viewMarks() {
        cout << "Marks: " << marks << endl;  // Allowed because marks is protected
    }
};

int main() {
    Faculty faculty("Dr. Mahir", 101, 80);
    faculty.displayInfo();
    faculty.updateMarks(95);

    StudentAccess student("Jenil", 102, 85);
    student.displayInfo();
    student.viewMarks();
    // student.marks = 100;  //  Error: Cannot modify protected member directly

    return 0;
}
```

### **Output:**
```
Name: Dr. Mahir, Roll No: 101
Marks updated to: 95
Name: Jenil, Roll No: 102
Marks: 85
```

**Key Takeaways:**  
- **Faculty (Teacher) can modify marks** because they have special permissions.  
- **Student can only view marks** and not change them.  
- The `marks` variable is **protected**, meaning it is **hidden from direct access** but available inside derived classes.

## **Advantages of Using Protected Members in Inheritance**  
**Encapsulation:** Keeps data secure while allowing controlled access.  
**Code Reusability:** Derived classes can use and modify protected members without rewriting the base class.  
**Hierarchical Access Control:** Different user roles (like student and faculty) can have **different access permissions**.  
**Prevents Accidental Modification:** Protected members are **hidden from direct modification**, reducing errors in complex programs.  

---

## **Conclusion**  
Protected members **bridge the gap between private and public access** by allowing **inheritance-based access control**. They are crucial in **real-world applications** where different users (like students and faculty) need **different access levels**. Understanding how different inheritance modes affect protected members **ensures better security and modular programming** in C++.
