# Inheritance and Polymorphism in C++

Inheritance and Polymorphism are two fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). These concepts help in writing reusable, scalable, and maintainable code by establishing relationships between different classes.

---

## **1. Inheritance in C++**
### **A. What is Inheritance?**
Inheritance is a mechanism in C++ that allows a class (child or derived class) to inherit attributes and behaviors from another class (parent or base class). It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.

#### **Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Vehicle {
public:
    string brand = "Toyota";
    void honk() {
        cout << "Beep! Beep!" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class inheriting from Vehicle
class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    string model = "Corolla";
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    cout << "Brand: " << myCar.brand << "\n";
    cout << "Model: " << myCar.model << "\n";
    myCar.honk();
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
Brand: Toyota
Model: Corolla
Beep! Beep!
```
Here, `Car` inherits `brand` and `honk()` from `Vehicle`, demonstrating the basic concept of inheritance.

### **B. Types of Inheritance in C++**

1. **Single Inheritance**: One derived class inherits from one base class.
2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from more than one base class.
3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from another derived class.
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of different types of inheritance.

#### **Example of Multiple Inheritance:**
```cpp
class Engine {
public:
    void engineType() {
        cout << "This is a V8 engine." << endl;
    }
};

class Transmission {
public:
    void transmissionType() {
        cout << "Automatic transmission." << endl;
    }
};

class SportsCar : public Engine, public Transmission {
public:
    void carType() {
        cout << "This is a sports car." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    SportsCar myCar;
    myCar.carType();
    myCar.engineType();
    myCar.transmissionType();
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
This is a sports car.
This is a V8 engine.
Automatic transmission.
```
Here, `SportsCar` inherits from both `Engine` and `Transmission`, showcasing multiple inheritance.

## **2. Polymorphism in C++**

### **A. What is Polymorphism?**
Polymorphism means "many forms" and allows one interface to be used for different data types. It enables a single function or operator to have multiple implementations.

### **B. Types of Polymorphism in C++**
1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding)**: Achieved through function overloading and operator overloading.
2. **Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)**: Achieved using function overriding with base and derived classes.

---

### **C. Function Overloading (Compile-Time Polymorphism)**
Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.

#### **Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Math {
public:
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};

int main() {
    Math obj;
    cout << "Sum (int): " << obj.add(2, 3) << endl;
    cout << "Sum (double): " << obj.add(2.5, 3.7) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
Sum (int): 5
Sum (double): 6.2
```
Here, the `add()` function is overloaded to work with both integers and doubles.

---

### **D. Operator Overloading (Compile-Time Polymorphism)**
Operator overloading allows user-defined data types to perform operations using built-in operators.

#### **Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;
    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    // Overloading + operator
    Complex operator + (const Complex& obj) {
        return Complex(real + obj.real, imag + obj.imag);
    }

    void display() {
        cout << real << " + " << imag << "i" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1(3, 4), c2(1, 2);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;
    c3.display();
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
4 + 6i
```
Here, the `+` operator is overloaded to add two `Complex` numbers.

---

### **E. Function Overriding (Run-Time Polymorphism)**
Function overriding allows a derived class to provide a specific implementation of a base class function.

#### **Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {
        cout << "Animal makes a sound" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* a = new Dog();
    a->makeSound();
    delete a;
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
Dog barks
```
Here, the `makeSound()` function is overridden in the derived `Dog` class, enabling run-time polymorphism.

---

## **Conclusion**
Inheritance and Polymorphism play a crucial role in C++ OOP. Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing a child class to derive properties from a parent class. Polymorphism enables flexibility by allowing functions and operators to work in multiple ways. These features make C++ a powerful language for building scalable applications.
