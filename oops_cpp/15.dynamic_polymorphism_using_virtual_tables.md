# **Dynamic Polymorphism Using Virtual Tables in C++**  

## **Introduction**  
**Dynamic polymorphism** is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows **function overriding** to be resolved at **runtime**. In C++, this is achieved using **virtual functions**, which are implemented internally using a **virtual table (vtable) and a virtual pointer (vptr)**.  

This article explains:  
- What dynamic polymorphism is  
- How virtual functions enable dynamic binding  
- The role of vtable and vptr  
- How function calls are resolved at runtime  
- Memory layout of objects with virtual functions

## **1. Understanding Dynamic Polymorphism**  

### **A. What is Polymorphism?**  
Polymorphism allows **the same function call** to behave differently based on the **object type**.  

There are two types of polymorphism:  
1. **Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism** → Achieved using **function overloading** and **operator overloading**  
2. **Runtime (Dynamic) Polymorphism** → Achieved using **virtual functions**  

### **B. How Dynamic Polymorphism Works?**  
- In **static binding**, the function to be called is decided at **compile-time**.  
- In **dynamic binding**, the function to be called is determined at **runtime** based on the **actual object type**.  
- **Virtual functions enable dynamic binding**, allowing derived class methods to be invoked through a base class pointer.

## **2. Role of Virtual Functions in Dynamic Polymorphism**  

### **A. Example Without Virtual Functions (Static Binding)**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    void show() {  // Non-virtual function
        cout << "Base class show function" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() {  // Function overriding
        cout << "Derived class show function" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* bptr;  
    Derived d;
    bptr = &d;  
    bptr->show();  // Calls Base class function (static binding)

    return 0;
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Base class show function
```
**Explanation:**  
- `bptr` is a **base class pointer** pointing to a `Derived` object.  
- Since `show()` is **not virtual**, function calls are resolved **at compile-time** based on the **pointer type** (`Base*`).  

---

### **B. Example With Virtual Functions (Dynamic Binding)**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {  // Virtual function
        cout << "Base class show function" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {  // Overriding virtual function
        cout << "Derived class show function" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* bptr;  
    Derived d;
    bptr = &d;  
    bptr->show();  // Calls Derived class function (dynamic binding)

    return 0;
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Derived class show function
```
**Explanation:**  
- Since `show()` is **virtual**, C++ uses **dynamic binding**.  
- The function is resolved at **runtime** based on the actual object type (`Derived`).  
- Internally, this is managed using a **vtable and vptr**.  

---

## **3. Virtual Table (vtable) and Virtual Pointer (vptr)**  

### **A. What is vtable?**  
A **virtual table (vtable)** is a hidden **lookup table** maintained by the compiler for each **class containing virtual functions**. It stores **pointers to virtual functions**.  

### **B. What is vptr?**  
A **virtual pointer (vptr)** is a hidden pointer in **each object** of a class that contains virtual functions. It **points to the vtable** of the corresponding class.  

---

## **4. How vtable and vptr Work Internally?**  

Consider the following code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { cout << "Base class show function" << endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { cout << "Derived class show function" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Base* bptr;
    Derived d;
    bptr = &d;
    bptr->show();  // Resolved using vtable

    return 0;
}
```

### **A. vtable Structure Created by Compiler**  
#### **Base Class vtable**
```
vtable_Base:
[0] → Base::show()
```

#### **Derived Class vtable**
```
vtable_Derived:
[0] → Derived::show()
```

---

### **B. Memory Layout of an Object with vptr**  
Each object of a class with virtual functions has a **hidden `vptr`**, which points to the **vtable**.  

#### **Memory Representation of a Derived Object**
```
Derived Object:
┌─────────────┐
│ vptr → vtable_Derived │
├─────────────┤
│ Data Members │
├─────────────┤
│ Functions   │
└─────────────┘
```
- When `bptr->show()` is called, the **vptr** in `Derived` object points to `vtable_Derived`, which calls `Derived::show()`.  
- This ensures that the correct function is called **at runtime**.  

---

## **5. Understanding Virtual Function Calls at Runtime**  

### **A. Steps of Function Call Resolution**
1. **Base class pointer (`bptr`) points to Derived class object (`d`).**  
2. **C++ fetches `vptr` from the `Derived` object.**  
3. **The `vptr` points to `vtable_Derived`.**  
4. **The function call is resolved dynamically by looking up `show()` in `vtable_Derived`.**  

### **B. Function Call Flow (Diagram)**
```
bptr->show()
   ↓
Fetch vptr from object
   ↓
vptr points to vtable_Derived
   ↓
Call Derived::show()
```

## **6. Virtual Destructors and Cleanup**  

If a **base class destructor is not virtual**, deleting a derived object through a base class pointer **causes memory leaks**.

### **Example Without Virtual Destructor (Memory Leak)**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base() { cout << "Base Constructor\n"; }
    ~Base() { cout << "Base Destructor\n"; }  // Not virtual
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() { cout << "Derived Constructor\n"; }
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived Destructor\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Base* bptr = new Derived();
    delete bptr;  // Only Base destructor is called (memory leak)
    return 0;
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Base Constructor
Derived Constructor
Base Destructor  // Derived Destructor is never called!
```

---

### **Solution: Use a Virtual Destructor**
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() { cout << "Base Destructor\n"; }
};
```
Now, `Derived`'s destructor is properly called, avoiding memory leaks.
