## Static Members in C++

### What are Static Members?
- **Static members** in a class are shared among all instances of the class, meaning they belong to the class itself, not to any specific object.
- They are defined using the keyword `static`.

There are two types of static members:
1. **Static Variables**
2. **Static Functions**

### 1. **Static Variables**

#### Features:
- **Single copy for all objects**: A static variable is shared among all objects of a class. Changing its value in one object will reflect in all other objects.
- **Lifetime**: It persists throughout the program's execution (similar to global variables).
- **Memory allocation**: Static variables are allocated in a fixed location (not in the stack or heap).
- **Initialization**: Static variables must be explicitly initialized outside the class definition.

#### Example: Static Variables
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Counter {
private:
    static int count; // Declaration of static variable

public:
    // Increment the counter
    void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    // Display the current count
    void display() {
        cout << "Current Count: " << count << endl;
    }
};

// Initialization of static variable
int Counter::count = 0;

int main() {
    Counter obj1, obj2;

    obj1.increment(); // Increments count to 1
    obj1.display();   // Output: Current Count: 1

    obj2.increment(); // Increments count to 2 (shared by obj1 and obj2)
    obj2.display();   // Output: Current Count: 2

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation:
- `int Counter::count = 0;`: The static variable `count` is defined and initialized outside the class.
- Both `obj1` and `obj2` share the same `count` variable. When `obj2` increments `count`, it reflects for `obj1` as well.

### 2. **Static Functions**

#### Features:
- **Class-specific**: Static functions belong to the class rather than an instance.
- **No access to non-static members**: They can only access other static variables or call static functions because they do not operate on an instance.
- **Called using the class name**: You donâ€™t need an object to call a static function.

#### Example: Static Functions
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Utility {
public:
    // Static function to add two numbers
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Static function to calculate the square of a number
    static int square(int num) {
        return num * num;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Calling static functions without creating an object
    cout << "Sum: " << Utility::add(10, 20) << endl;       // Output: Sum: 30
    cout << "Square: " << Utility::square(5) << endl;     // Output: Square: 25

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation:
- Static functions like `add` and `square` do not require an object of the class to be called. They are called directly using the class name (`Utility::add`).

### Accessing Static Members

#### Accessing Static Variables
1. **Outside the Class**:
   Static variables are accessed using the `ClassName::VariableName` syntax (e.g., `Counter::count`).
2. **Inside the Class**:
   Static variables can be accessed directly if the function accessing them is also static. Otherwise, they need an object or class name for access.

#### Accessing Static Functions
1. **Directly with the Class Name**:
   Use `ClassName::FunctionName` (e.g., `Utility::add`).
2. **Optional with Objects**:
   You can also use an object to call a static function, but it's not recommended as it defeats the purpose of static.

### Example: Static Members (Combined)
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Bank {
private:
    static int totalAccounts; // Static variable to keep track of all accounts

public:
    // Constructor increments total accounts
    Bank() {
        totalAccounts++;
    }

    // Static function to display total accounts
    static void displayTotalAccounts() {
        cout << "Total Bank Accounts: " << totalAccounts << endl;
    }
};

// Initialize the static variable
int Bank::totalAccounts = 0;

int main() {
    Bank acc1, acc2, acc3;

    // Call static function using the class name
    Bank::displayTotalAccounts(); // Output: Total Bank Accounts: 3

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation:
- The static variable `totalAccounts` is incremented every time a new object is created.
- The static function `displayTotalAccounts` shows the total count of accounts.

### Key Points to Remember:
1. **Static Variables**:
   - Shared by all objects of the class.
   - Need to be initialized outside the class.
   - Can be accessed using the class name (`ClassName::StaticVariable`).

2. **Static Functions**:
   - Belong to the class, not an instance.
   - Cannot access non-static variables or call non-static functions.
   - Can be called using the class name (`ClassName::StaticFunction`).

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Static members are stored in a fixed memory location for the program's lifetime.

---

### Real-World Analogy

Imagine a **bank** where:
- **Static Variable**: The total number of accounts is shared across all branches of the bank. No matter which branch creates an account, it updates the same total count.
- **Static Function**: A function to fetch the total number of accounts is available for all branches, but it does not depend on any single branch (or object).

This is how static variables and functions provide global functionality to a class.
