### **Constructors and Destructors**

In C++, constructors and destructors are special member functions that handle the initialization and cleanup of objects. These functions are essential for resource management, ensuring that objects are properly set up and cleaned up during their lifecycle. Let's explore the types of constructors and the role of destructors in detail.

---

### **1. Constructors**
A constructor is a special member function with the same name as the class. It is automatically called when an object of the class is created. Constructors are primarily used to initialize objects.

#### **Characteristics of Constructors**:
- They have the same name as the class.
- They do not have a return type.
- They can be overloaded.
- They are invoked automatically when an object is created.

In C++, **overloading** means that you can define multiple functions or operators with the **same name** but with **different arguments** (number or types). Overloading is a way to give multiple definitions to the same functionality, depending on the context.

### For example:
**Function Overloading**: You can have multiple versions of the same function name that accept different parameters.

---

In the context of **constructors and the assignment operator**:

1. **Constructors** can be overloaded:
   - You can define multiple constructors in a class with different parameter lists, enabling objects to be initialized in different ways.
   - For example:
     ```cpp
     class Student {
     public:
         // Constructor 1: No arguments
         Student() {
             cout << "Default constructor called" << endl;
         }

         // Constructor 2: With one argument
         Student(string name) {
             cout << "Constructor with name: " << name << endl;
         }

         // Constructor 3: With two arguments
         Student(string name, int age) {
             cout << "Constructor with name and age: " << name << ", " << age << endl;
         }
     };
     ```

   **Use**:
   ```cpp
   Student s1;              // Calls Constructor 1
   Student s2("Arjun");     // Calls Constructor 2
   Student s3("Yashvi", 20); // Calls Constructor 3
   ```

#### **Types of Constructors**

---

#### **1.1 Default Constructor**
A default constructor is a constructor that takes no arguments. It initializes an object with default values.

**Example from CodingGita:**  
In the CodingGita BTech program, imagine a scenario where we create a default student profile.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
private:
    string name;
    int rollNumber;

public:
    // Default Constructor
    Student() {
        name = "Unknown";
        rollNumber = 0;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Roll Number: " << rollNumber << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student student1; // Default constructor is called
    student1.display();
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Name: Unknown, Roll Number: 0
```

---

#### **1.2 Parameterized Constructor**
A parameterized constructor takes arguments and allows the programmer to initialize objects with specific values.

**Example from CodingGita:**  
Imagine assigning details to a student in CodingGita's database.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
private:
    string name;
    int rollNumber;

public:
    // Parameterized Constructor
    Student(string n, int r) {
        name = n;
        rollNumber = r;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Roll Number: " << rollNumber << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student student1("Yashvi", 101);
    Student student2("Mahir", 102);

    student1.display();
    student2.display();

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Name: Yashvi, Roll Number: 101
Name: Mahir, Roll Number: 102
```

---

#### **1.3 Copy Constructor**
A **copy constructor** creates a new object as a copy of an existing object. The default copy constructor provided by the compiler performs a shallow copy, which can lead to issues when the object contains dynamically allocated memory or other non-trivial resources. Defining a custom copy constructor allows for a deep copy, ensuring proper duplication of all resources owned by the original object.

**Why do we need a copy constructor?**
- To avoid sharing memory between objects, which can lead to data corruption or memory errors.
- To ensure proper duplication of dynamically allocated resources.

- **Shallow Copy**: Copies the memory addresses (pointers) instead of the actual data. If one object changes the data, it affects the other because both objects share the same memory. **(Default behavior of copy constructor)**

- **Deep Copy**: Creates a new copy of the data in a different memory location. Both objects have their own separate copies of the data, avoiding unintended changes. **(Requires a custom copy constructor)**

---

**Example from CodingGita: Deep Copy Implementation**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
private:
    string name;
    int mark1, mark2; // Separate variables for marks

public:
    // Parameterized Constructor
    Student(string n, int m1, int m2) : name(n), mark1(m1), mark2(m2) {}

    // Copy Constructor
    Student(const Student &s) : name(s.name), mark1(s.mark1), mark2(s.mark2) {}

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Marks: " << mark1 << ", " << mark2 << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student student1("Arjun", 85, 90);

    Student student2 = student1; // Copy constructor is called

    student1.display();
    student2.display();

    return 0;
}

```

**Output:**
```
Name: Arjun, Marks: 85 90 95 
Name: Arjun, Marks: 85 90 95 
```

**What does the `&` symbol mean in the copy constructor?**
The `&` in the parameter `const Student &s` indicates passing by reference, avoiding infinite recursion and unnecessary copying. The `const` ensures the original object is not modified.

---

### **2. Destructor**

A **destructor** is a special member function that is called automatically when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Its primary purpose is to release resources allocated to the object.

#### **Characteristics of Destructors**:
- They have the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde (~).
- They do not take arguments and do not return a value.
- A class can have only one destructor.

**Example from CodingGita:**  
Consider a scenario where a student logs out, and we need to clean up their session data.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
private:
    string name;

public:
    // Parameterized Constructor
    Student(string n) {
        name = n;
        cout << "Constructor called for " << name << endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Student() {
        cout << "Destructor called for " << name << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student student1("Krishna");
    Student student2("Priyasha");

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Constructor called for Krishna
Constructor called for Priyasha
Destructor called for Priyasha
Destructor called for Krishna
```
