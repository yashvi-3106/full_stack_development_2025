# **Constructor and Destructor Behavior in Inheritance**  

## **Introduction**
In C++, constructors and destructors play a crucial role in initializing and cleaning up objects. When **inheritance** is involved, their behavior follows a specific order to ensure that both the **base class** and **derived class** are properly initialized and destroyed.  

This article explores:  
1. **How constructors work in inheritance**  
2. **How destructors behave in inheritance**  
3. **Order of execution**  
4. **Explicit constructor calls in derived classes**  
5. **Virtual destructors** and their significance

## **1. Constructor Behavior in Inheritance**
A **constructor** is a special member function that initializes an object when it is created.  

### **Key Rules of Constructor Execution in Inheritance**
1. **Base class constructor executes first** before the derived class constructor.  
2. If a derived class does not explicitly call the base class constructor, the **default constructor** of the base class is called automatically.  
3. If the base class has **parameterized constructors**, the derived class must explicitly call them.  

### **Example: Constructor Execution in Inheritance**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base() { cout << "Base Class Constructor Called" << endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() { cout << "Derived Class Constructor Called" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
Base Class Constructor Called
Derived Class Constructor Called
```
**Explanation:**
- When `Derived obj;` is created, first the **Base** class constructor executes.
- Then, the **Derived** class constructor executes.  

This ensures that the base class is always initialized before the derived class.

---

## **2. Constructor with Parameters in Inheritance**
If the **base class has parameterized constructors**, the derived class must explicitly invoke them.

### **Example: Calling a Parameterized Constructor of the Base Class**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base(int x) { 
        cout << "Base Class Constructor Called with value: " << x << endl; 
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived(int y) : Base(y) { // Explicitly calling Base constructor
        cout << "Derived Class Constructor Called" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj(10);
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
Base Class Constructor Called with value: 10
Derived Class Constructor Called
```
**Explanation:**
- The **Derived class constructor** explicitly calls the base class constructor using `Base(y)`.  
- This ensures the base class constructor is properly initialized with the required arguments.  

---

## **3. Destructor Behavior in Inheritance**
A **destructor** is a special member function that is executed when an object is destroyed.  

### **Key Rules of Destructor Execution in Inheritance**
1. **Derived class destructor executes first**, then the base class destructor.  
2. This ensures proper cleanup, as derived class members might depend on the base class.  

### **Example: Destructor Execution Order**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base() { cout << "Base Constructor Called" << endl; }
    ~Base() { cout << "Base Destructor Called" << endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() { cout << "Derived Constructor Called" << endl; }
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived Destructor Called" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
Base Constructor Called
Derived Constructor Called
Derived Destructor Called
Base Destructor Called
```
**Explanation:**
- Constructors execute **from base to derived** (`Base → Derived`).  
- Destructors execute **from derived to base** (`Derived → Base`).  

This ensures that the **derived class cleans up its own resources first**, before the base class is destroyed.

---

## **4. Explicitly Calling Base Class Constructor in Derived Class**
By default, the **default constructor** of the base class is invoked if no explicit constructor is provided in the derived class.  

However, if the base class has **multiple constructors**, we need to explicitly call the correct one.

### **Example: Using Different Base Class Constructors**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base() { cout << "Default Base Constructor" << endl; }
    Base(int x) { cout << "Parameterized Base Constructor: " << x << endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived(int y) : Base(y) { // Explicitly calling parameterized constructor
        cout << "Derived Constructor Called" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj(42);
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
Parameterized Base Constructor: 42
Derived Constructor Called
```
**Explanation:**
- The derived class constructor `Derived(int y)` explicitly calls `Base(y)`, ensuring the correct base class constructor is invoked.

---

## **5. Virtual Destructors and Why They Matter**
If a base class has a **virtual destructor**, it ensures that the correct destructor sequence is followed, even when deleting objects via base class pointers.

### **Why Use Virtual Destructors?**
1. Prevents **memory leaks** when dealing with polymorphism.  
2. Ensures that both **base and derived destructors** execute properly.  

### **Example: Virtual Destructor Ensuring Proper Cleanup**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base() { cout << "Base Constructor" << endl; }
    virtual ~Base() { cout << "Base Destructor" << endl; } // Virtual Destructor
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() { cout << "Derived Constructor" << endl; }
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived Destructor" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived(); // Creating Derived object using Base pointer
    delete obj; // Proper destruction due to virtual destructor
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
Base Constructor
Derived Constructor
Derived Destructor
Base Destructor
```
**Without a virtual destructor, the output would be:**
```
Base Constructor
Derived Constructor
Base Destructor
```
- The **Derived destructor is skipped**, causing a memory leak.  
- Using a **virtual destructor** ensures the correct order of destruction.

## **6. Key Takeaways**
| **Concept** | **Behavior** |
|------------|-------------|
| **Constructor Execution Order** | Base class constructor → Derived class constructor |
| **Destructor Execution Order** | Derived class destructor → Base class destructor |
| **Parameterized Constructors** | Derived class must explicitly call them using `Base(arguments)` |
| **Virtual Destructor** | Ensures proper cleanup in polymorphism |
| **Implicit Base Constructor Call** | If not explicitly called, the default constructor is used |

---

## **Conclusion**
- **Constructors in inheritance** always execute **from base to derived** to ensure proper initialization.
- **Destructors execute in reverse order** to safely deallocate resources before the base class is destroyed.
- If a base class has **parameterized constructors**, the derived class **must explicitly call** them.
- **Virtual destructors** are crucial in polymorphism to prevent memory leaks.
