# Core Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes. It enables modular, reusable, and scalable code by structuring software into interacting objects. The core concepts of OOP include **Objects and Classes**, **Abstraction**, and **Encapsulation**, which we will explore in depth.

## **1. Objects and Classes**

### **A. What is a Class?**

A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions) that an object of the class will have.

#### **Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Define a class named Car
class Car {
public:
    // Data members (attributes)
    string brand;
    int year;

    // Member function (method)
    void display() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Year: " << year << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;  // Creating an object of class Car
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.year = 2022;
    myCar.display();
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Brand: Toyota, Year: 2022
```

Here, **Car** is a class that defines the structure of a car object, and **myCar** is an instance of that class.

---

### **B. What is an Object?**

An **object** is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains specific values for the properties defined in the class.

#### **Key Features of Objects:**

- Each object has a unique identity.
- Objects hold their own data and behaviors defined by the class.

#### **Multiple Objects Example:**

```cpp
Car car1, car2;
car1.brand = "Honda";
car1.year = 2021;
car2.brand = "Ford";
car2.year = 2023;
car1.display();
car2.display();
```

Each object (`car1`, `car2`) has its own data while using the same class structure.

## **2. Abstraction in OOP**

### **A. What is Abstraction?**

Abstraction is the process of **hiding implementation details** and exposing only the essential features of an object. It simplifies complex systems by focusing on relevant details.

#### **Example of Abstraction:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;  // Hidden data (implementation detail)

public:
    // Constructor
    BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Public method to deposit money
    void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
        cout << "Deposited: " << amount << endl;
    }

    // Public method to display balance
    void showBalance() {
        cout << "Balance: " << balance << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    BankAccount myAccount(1000); // Creating object with initial balance
    myAccount.deposit(500);
    myAccount.showBalance();
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Deposited: 500
Balance: 1500
```

Here, the `balance` variable is private, ensuring that users of `BankAccount` class cannot modify it directly. Instead, they use the `deposit()` and `showBalance()` methods, hiding unnecessary details.

#### **Advantages of Abstraction:**

- Reduces code complexity.
- Enhances maintainability.
- Prevents direct access to sensitive data.

## **3. Encapsulation in OOP**

### **A. What is Encapsulation?**

Encapsulation is the technique of **bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) together** within a class while restricting direct access to some components. It protects data integrity and ensures controlled access.

### **Encapsulation in Action:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
private:
    string name;
    int age;

public:
    // Setter methods
    void setName(string n) { name = n; }
    void setAge(int a) {
        if(a > 0) age = a;  // Data validation
        else cout << "Invalid age!" << endl;
    }

    // Getter methods
    string getName() { return name; }
    int getAge() { return age; }
};

int main() {
    Student s;
    s.setName("Jenil");
    s.setAge(20);
    cout << "Name: " << s.getName() << ", Age: " << s.getAge() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Name: Jenil, Age: 20
```

### **Encapsulation Rules:**

- **Use private data members** to restrict direct access.
- **Provide public setter and getter methods** to control data modification.
- **Ensure data integrity** using validation.

#### **Benefits of Encapsulation:**

✅ Protects data from accidental modification.
✅ Improves modularity.
✅ Increases code reusability and security.

## **Conclusion**

Understanding **Objects and Classes**, **Abstraction**, and **Encapsulation** is essential in OOP. These concepts allow programmers to write **efficient, secure, and maintainable** code.
