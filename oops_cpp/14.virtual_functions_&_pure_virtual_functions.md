# **Virtual Functions and Pure Virtual Functions in C++**  

In C++, **virtual functions** and **pure virtual functions** are key concepts in achieving **dynamic polymorphism**. They allow for flexibility and extensibility in object-oriented programming by enabling **runtime method overriding**.  

This article explores:  
- What virtual functions are  
- How they enable runtime polymorphism  
- The concept of pure virtual functions  
- The role of abstract classes  
- How the virtual table (vtable) and virtual pointer (vptr) work

## **1. Virtual Functions in C++**  

### **A. What is a Virtual Function?**  
A **virtual function** is a member function in a base class that can be **overridden in a derived class**. It allows function calls to be **resolved at runtime** instead of compile time, enabling **dynamic polymorphism**.  

A function is declared **virtual** using the `virtual` keyword in the base class.  

### **B. Example of Virtual Function**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {  // Virtual function
        cout << "Base class show function" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {  // Overriding virtual function
        cout << "Derived class show function" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* bptr;  // Base class pointer
    Derived d;
    
    bptr = &d;  // Base class pointer points to derived class object
    bptr->show();  // Calls Derived class function at runtime

    return 0;
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Derived class show function
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `show()` function in `Base` is marked as `virtual`, so when a **base class pointer** points to a `Derived` object, the overridden `show()` in `Derived` executes.  
- Without `virtual`, the base class function would execute instead (static binding).  

---

### **C. Rules for Virtual Functions**  
1. Virtual functions **must be declared in the base class**.  
2. They **must be overridden** in the derived class to provide specific behavior.  
3. **Function calls are resolved at runtime** (dynamic binding).  
4. A **base class pointer** or reference should be used to invoke them.  
5. **Constructors cannot be virtual**, but **destructors should be virtual** to ensure proper cleanup in derived classes.  

---

## **2. Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes**  

### **A. What is a Pure Virtual Function?**  
A **pure virtual function** is a virtual function that has **no implementation** in the base class and **must** be overridden in derived classes. It is declared using `= 0`.  

A class containing at least **one pure virtual function** is called an **abstract class** and **cannot be instantiated**.

### **B. Example of Pure Virtual Function**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Abstract base class
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};

// Derived class overriding pure virtual function
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Circle" << endl;
    }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Rectangle" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* s1 = new Circle();   // Base class pointer to derived object
    Shape* s2 = new Rectangle();
    
    s1->draw();  // Calls Circle's draw()
    s2->draw();  // Calls Rectangle's draw()
    
    delete s1;
    delete s2;

    return 0;
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Drawing Circle
Drawing Rectangle
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `Shape` class has a pure virtual function `draw()`, making it an **abstract class**.  
- Any class inheriting from `Shape` **must override `draw()`**, or it will also be an abstract class.  
- The base class pointer (`Shape*`) is used to call the overridden functions dynamically.  

---

### **C. Properties of Pure Virtual Functions**
1. A **pure virtual function is declared as `= 0`** in the base class.  
2. Any class containing at least **one pure virtual function becomes an abstract class**.  
3. **Abstract classes cannot be instantiated**.  
4. **Derived classes must override the pure virtual function**, otherwise, they also become abstract.  
5. **Dynamic polymorphism is achieved using base class pointers or references**.  

---

## **3. Virtual Table (VTable) and Virtual Pointer (VPTR)**
### **A. How Does the Virtual Function Mechanism Work Internally?**  

In C++, when a class has **at least one virtual function**, the compiler creates:  

1. **Virtual Table (vtable)**:  
   - A lookup table containing function pointers for virtual functions.  
   - Each class with virtual functions has its own vtable.  
   
2. **Virtual Pointer (vptr)**:  
   - Each object of a class with virtual functions has a **hidden pointer** (`vptr`) to the **vtable** of its class.  

---

### **B. Understanding vtable and vptr with an Example**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { cout << "Base class show function" << endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { cout << "Derived class show function" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Base* bptr;  
    Derived d;
    bptr = &d;
    bptr->show();  // Calls Derived's function using vtable

    return 0;
}
```
### **How the Compiler Handles This:**
- **Base Class vtable**  
  ```
  vtable_Base:
  [0] → Base::show()
  ```

- **Derived Class vtable**  
  ```
  vtable_Derived:
  [0] → Derived::show()
  ```

- **Memory Layout:**
  ```
  Derived Object:
  ┌─────────────┐
  │ vptr → vtable_Derived │
  ├─────────────┤
  │ Data Members │
  ├─────────────┤
  │ Functions   │
  └─────────────┘
  ```
  - The `vptr` of `Derived` class object points to `vtable_Derived`, which ensures **runtime resolution of function calls**.  

---

## **4. Virtual Destructor in C++**
A **virtual destructor** ensures proper cleanup of derived class objects when deleted through a base class pointer.

### **Example of Virtual Destructor**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base() { cout << "Base Constructor\n"; }
    virtual ~Base() { cout << "Base Destructor\n"; }  // Virtual destructor
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() { cout << "Derived Constructor\n"; }
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived Destructor\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Base* bptr = new Derived();
    delete bptr;  // Ensures Derived's destructor is called
    return 0;
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Base Constructor
Derived Constructor
Derived Destructor
Base Destructor
```
Without a **virtual destructor**, the **Derived destructor wouldn’t be called**, causing a memory leak.

## **5. Key Differences: Virtual vs. Pure Virtual Functions**
| Feature                 | Virtual Function | Pure Virtual Function |
|------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Has Implementation?   | Yes (in base class) | No (declared as `= 0`) |
| Needs to be Overridden? | No (optional) | Yes (mandatory) |
| Can Instantiate Base Class? | Yes | No (abstract class) |

---

## **Conclusion**
- **Virtual functions** enable **runtime polymorphism** by allowing function overriding in derived classes.  
- **Pure virtual functions** make a class **abstract**, forcing derived classes to implement them.  
- **Vtable and vptr** manage function resolution dynamically.  
- **Virtual destructors** ensure proper cleanup of derived objects.
