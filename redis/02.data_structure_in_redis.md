# Data Structures in Redis

Redis supports **five core data structures**, each designed for specific use-cases and access patterns. These are:

1. **Strings**  
2. **Lists**  
3. **Sets**  
4. **Hashes**  
5. **Sorted Sets (ZSets)**

Each structure is optimized for fast in-memory operations and has a dedicated set of commands.

---

## 1. 🔹 **Strings**  
The simplest and most commonly used data structure in Redis.

### 📌 Characteristics:
- Value is a sequence of bytes (binary-safe).
- Can be used to store text, integers, or serialized objects.
- Max size of a string value: **512 MB**.

### 📂 Use-cases:
- Caching data (e.g., API responses)
- Storing session tokens or flags
- Rate-limiting counters
- Feature flags

### 🛠️ Key Commands:

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SET key value` | Set a string value |
| `GET key` | Retrieve the string value |
| `INCR key` | Atomically increment an integer value |
| `DECR key` | Atomically decrement an integer |
| `APPEND key value` | Append to existing string |
| `STRLEN key` | Length of string |

### 🔍 Example:

```bash
SET user:1001:name "Yashvi"
GET user:1001:name
INCR visit:count         # visit:count = 1
APPEND user:1001:name " Patel" 
```

---

## 2. 🔹 **Lists**  
An ordered collection of string elements. Think of them like a doubly-linked list.

### 📌 Characteristics:
- Elements are ordered (insertion order preserved).
- Can efficiently add/remove items from **both ends**.
- Ideal for **FIFO** (queue) or **LIFO** (stack) structures.

### 📂 Use-cases:
- Task/job queues
- Activity feeds or timelines
- Message buffering

### 🛠️ Key Commands:

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `LPUSH key value` | Insert at head (left) |
| `RPUSH key value` | Insert at tail (right) |
| `LPOP key` | Remove from head |
| `RPOP key` | Remove from tail |
| `LRANGE key start end` | Get a range of elements |
| `LLEN key` | List length |

### 🔍 Example:

```bash
LPUSH queue:emails "email1" "email2"
RPUSH queue:emails "email3"
LRANGE queue:emails 0 -1       # ["email2", "email1", "email3"]
LPOP queue:emails              # "email2"
```

---

## 3. 🔹 **Sets**  
An **unordered** collection of **unique** string values.

### 📌 Characteristics:
- Duplicate entries are automatically ignored.
- Internally implemented using a hash table.
- Supports set operations like **union**, **intersection**, and **difference**.

### 📂 Use-cases:
- Track unique visitors
- Tagging systems
- Avoiding duplication (e.g., unique voters)

### 🛠️ Key Commands:

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SADD key member [member ...]` | Add one or more elements |
| `SMEMBERS key` | Get all members |
| `SISMEMBER key value` | Check membership |
| `SREM key value` | Remove a member |
| `SUNION key1 key2` | Union of two sets |
| `SINTER key1 key2` | Intersection of sets |

### 🔍 Example:

```bash
SADD course:students "Arjun" "Mahir" "Yashvi"
SISMEMBER course:students "Krishna"  # false
SMEMBERS course:students             # {"Arjun", "Mahir", "Yashvi"}
```

---

## 4. 🔹 **Hashes**  
A collection of **field-value pairs**, similar to a row in a database or an object in a JSON document.

### 📌 Characteristics:
- Best used to store objects (like user profiles, product details).
- Efficient for retrieving or modifying individual fields.

### 📂 Use-cases:
- Representing structured data (users, products)
- Updating subfields without replacing the entire value

### 🛠️ Key Commands:

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `HSET key field value` | Set a field |
| `HGET key field` | Get value of a field |
| `HGETALL key` | Get all fields and values |
| `HDEL key field` | Delete a field |
| `HEXISTS key field` | Check if field exists |
| `HINCRBY key field n` | Increment field by value `n` |

### 🔍 Example:

```bash
HSET user:1001 name "Priyesha" age "23" city "Surat"
HGET user:1001 name              # "Priyesha"
HGETALL user:1001                # {name: "Priyesha", age: "23", city: "Surat"}
```

---

## 5. 🔹 **Sorted Sets (ZSets)**  
Similar to Sets but with a **score** associated with each member that determines ordering.

### 📌 Characteristics:
- Members are unique.
- Score is a floating-point number.
- Automatically keeps elements sorted by score.

### 📂 Use-cases:
- Leaderboards
- Ranking systems
- Time-based event queues (timestamps as scores)

### 🛠️ Key Commands:

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ZADD key score member` | Add a member with score |
| `ZRANGE key start end [WITHSCORES]` | Get members in order |
| `ZREVRANGE key start end` | Reverse order |
| `ZINCRBY key increment member` | Increment score of a member |
| `ZRANK key member` | Get the rank of a member |

### 🔍 Example:

```bash
ZADD leaderboard 1500 "Krishna"
ZADD leaderboard 1600 "Arjun"
ZINCRBY leaderboard 50 "Krishna"
ZRANGE leaderboard 0 -1 WITHSCORES
```

## ⚙️ Internal Efficiency and Performance

Redis uses optimized C implementations for each data structure:

| Data Structure | Internal Implementation |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| String         | Simple dynamic strings (SDS) |
| List           | Quicklist (compressed linked list + array) |
| Set            | Hash tables or intsets |
| Hash           | Hashtable (dict) or ziplist |
| Sorted Set     | Skiplist + hashtable |

Redis automatically chooses compact representations (e.g., ziplist, intset) for memory efficiency on small datasets.

## 🧠 When to Use Which Data Structure?

| Use-case | Recommended Structure |
|----------|------------------------|
| Caching a single value | String |
| Representing user profile | Hash |
| Recent activities | List |
| Unique tags or categories | Set |
| Real-time leaderboards | Sorted Set |

## 🧾 Summary

| Data Type | Ordered? | Unique Values? | Score/Field Support? | Use-cases |
|-----------|----------|----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| String    | ✖️        | ✖️              | ✖️                    | Basic storage, counters |
| List      | ✅        | ✖️              | ✖️                    | Queues, feeds |
| Set       | ✖️        | ✅              | ✖️                    | Tags, unique items |
| Hash      | ✖️        | Field-based     | ✅                    | Objects, profiles |
| Sorted Set| ✅        | ✅              | ✅                    | Rankings, time-series |

Redis is not only fast — it’s **versatile**. Each data structure has a rich set of atomic commands allowing powerful, high-performance operations right from the Redis CLI or client library.
