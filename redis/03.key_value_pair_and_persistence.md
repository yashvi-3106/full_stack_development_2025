# Working with Key-Value Pairs and Managing Expiration & Persistence in Redis

Redis is best known as a fast, in-memory **key-value data store** that supports various data types and advanced features like automatic expiration and persistence. At the heart of Redis lies the concept of storing and manipulating data using **keys** and **values**.

This article will explore:
1. **Key-Value Operations in Redis**
2. **Expiration: Automatic Key Management**
3. **Persistence: Saving Data to Disk**

## 📦 1. Working with Key-Value Pairs in Redis

Redis keys can be associated with different types of values, such as **strings, hashes, lists, sets**, or **sorted sets**. The key is always a **binary-safe string**, and it acts as the identifier for accessing or modifying the associated value.

### 📌 Key Characteristics:
- **Keys** are case-sensitive and can be up to 512 MB.
- **Values** can be of various data types.
- Every operation is **atomic**.
- You can **overwrite** an existing key by using `SET` again.

### ✅ Basic Key-Value Operations:

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SET key value` | Store a key with a string value |
| `GET key` | Retrieve the value of a key |
| `DEL key` | Delete a key |
| `EXISTS key` | Check if a key exists |
| `TYPE key` | Get the type of value stored |
| `RENAME oldkey newkey` | Rename a key |
| `KEYS pattern` | Find keys matching a pattern |
| `FLUSHALL` / `FLUSHDB` | Delete all keys (global or current DB) |

### 🔍 Example:

```bash
SET user:1001 "Jenil"
GET user:1001                     # "Jenil"
EXISTS user:1001                  # 1 (true)
DEL user:1001
EXISTS user:1001                  # 0 (false)
```

### 🔎 Wildcard Pattern Matching with KEYS:

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `*` | Any number of characters |
| `?` | Exactly one character |
| `[abc]` | a, b, or c |
| `user:*` | All keys starting with `user:` |

```bash
KEYS user:*       # Returns all user-related keys
```

⚠️ **Note:** Avoid `KEYS` in production on large datasets — use `SCAN` for safer iteration.

## ⏳ 2. Expiration in Redis

Redis allows you to set **expiration times** on keys, meaning they will be **automatically deleted** after a certain duration.

This is especially useful for:
- Session storage
- Temporary caches
- One-time passwords (OTP)
- API rate limiting

### 🧭 Ways to Set Expiration:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `EXPIRE key seconds` | Set a timeout in seconds |
| `PEXPIRE key milliseconds` | Set timeout in ms |
| `TTL key` | Get time-to-live in seconds |
| `PTTL key` | Time-to-live in ms |
| `SET key value EX seconds` | Set + expiration in one |
| `SET key value PX milliseconds` | Set + ms expiration |

### 🔍 Example:

```bash
SET otp:123456 "793421" EX 300        # OTP expires in 5 min
TTL otp:123456                        # Returns time left
EXPIRE session:krishna 1800           # 30 min session
```

### 🔁 Modifying Expiration:

- Use `PERSIST key` to remove a key's expiration:
  ```bash
  PERSIST otp:123456
  ```

- You can reset TTL by using `EXPIRE` again or re-setting the key.

### 🧠 How Redis Handles Expired Keys:
- Redis does **not immediately delete** expired keys.
- It uses **lazy deletion** (access time check) and **periodic scanning** (10 keys at a time in a loop).
- This strategy avoids performance spikes but keeps memory under control.

## 💾 3. Persistence in Redis

Even though Redis is an **in-memory store**, it provides multiple options for **persistence**, so your data can survive server restarts or crashes.

Redis supports two primary forms of persistence:

---

### 🗂 A. **RDB (Redis Database Backup) Snapshots**

Creates **point-in-time snapshots** of your data at specified intervals.

#### 📌 Configuration:
In `redis.conf`, you can define:
```ini
save 900 1       # 1 change in 15 minutes
save 300 10      # 10 changes in 5 minutes
save 60 10000    # 10,000 changes in 1 minute
```

#### 📁 Output File:
- Stored in binary format: `dump.rdb`
- Lightweight, but may lose recent changes on crash.

#### 🧾 Manual Snapshot:
```bash
SAVE         # Blocking save
BGSAVE       # Non-blocking, recommended
```

---

### 🧾 B. **AOF (Append-Only File)**

Logs every write operation to a file (`appendonly.aof`) in sequential order.

#### 📌 Characteristics:
- More **durable** than RDB (can recover every command).
- Slower than RDB due to logging every write.
- You can configure how often it syncs data to disk:
  ```ini
  appendfsync always     # Every command (slowest but safest)
  appendfsync everysec   # Once per second (balanced)
  appendfsync no         # OS decides (fastest, least safe)
  ```

#### 🔄 Rewrite AOF:
Over time, the file grows. Redis can compact it:
```bash
BGREWRITEAOF
```

---

### 🔁 Can You Use Both RDB and AOF?

Yes. Redis allows using **both together** to strike a balance:
- Use RDB for fast recovery on full data dumps.
- Use AOF for durability of recent changes.

In case of a restart, Redis will **prefer AOF** if both exist.

---

## ⚙️ Summary Table

| Feature | RDB | AOF |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Durability | Medium | High |
| File Size | Small | Large |
| Performance | High | Slower |
| Recovery Speed | Fast | Slower |
| Use-case | Backup | Reliability |

## 📌 Conclusion

Redis’s key-value model is extremely powerful thanks to:
- **Flexible operations on keys**
- **Optional time-to-live (TTL)** for temporary data
- **Persistence mechanisms** to ensure data safety

Whether you’re building a **cache**, **message queue**, **real-time leaderboard**, or **session store**, understanding how to manage key lifecycles and persistence options is crucial for designing reliable systems with Redis.
