# **Setting up Routing in Angular**

In any modern web application, routing plays a crucial role in building a **Single Page Application (SPA)**. Angular provides a **powerful and flexible router** that allows you to map different **URLs to components**, enabling seamless navigation without full-page reloads.

---

## **What is Routing in Angular?**

Routing refers to the process of defining navigation between **different views or components** of an Angular application, based on the **URL in the browser**.

In traditional web apps, each page navigation triggers a **server request** and reloads the full page. In Angular, routing is **client-side**, meaning components change dynamically without reloading the entire page.

---

## **Why Routing is Important**

- Maintains a **clean URL structure**
- Enables **modular UI design**
- Supports **navigation without full-page reloads**
- Helps with **lazy loading** and **code splitting**
- Integrates easily with **guards** for authentication
- Makes the app feel more like a **native application**

---

## **Basic Terms in Angular Routing**

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Route** | Defines a path and maps it to a component |
| **RouterModule** | The Angular module that enables routing |
| **RouterOutlet** | A directive that displays the component for the active route |
| **RouterLink** | A directive used to create clickable links for routing |
| **ActivatedRoute** | Provides access to route data and parameters |

---

# **Step-by-Step: Setting Up Routing in Angular**

---

## **Step 1: Enable Routing When Creating an Angular App**

When you create a new Angular project, Angular CLI prompts you to include routing.

```bash
ng new codinggita-angular-app
```

You’ll be asked:

```
Would you like to add Angular routing? (y/N)
```

Choose **Yes (y)**.

This will:
- Automatically import `RouterModule` in `AppModule`
- Create `app-routing.module.ts` file
- Configure the app to be ready for routing

If your project already exists and you didn’t enable routing, you can manually add it.

---

## **Step 2: Create Components to Use as Routes**

You’ll need components that will serve as the views for your application.

```bash
ng generate component home
ng generate component about
ng generate component contact
```

This creates:
- `home.component.ts`
- `about.component.ts`
- `contact.component.ts`

Each of these will be mapped to a route.

---

## **Step 3: Configure Routes in `app-routing.module.ts`**

This file is where you define the actual paths and which component should load for which path.

### `app-routing.module.ts`:

```ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component';
import { ContactComponent } from './contact/contact.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent }, // Default route
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
  { path: 'contact', component: ContactComponent },
  { path: '**', redirectTo: '' } // Wildcard route (fallback)
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

### Explanation:

- `path: ''` – Empty path matches the root URL and loads `HomeComponent`.
- `path: 'about'` – Matches `/about` and loads `AboutComponent`.
- `path: '**'` – Wildcard route; catches any undefined routes and redirects to the homepage.

---

## **Step 4: Add `<router-outlet>` to Display Routes**

In `app.component.html`, remove the default HTML and add the `router-outlet` directive:

```html
<nav>
  <a routerLink="/">Home</a> |
  <a routerLink="/about">About</a> |
  <a routerLink="/contact">Contact</a>
</nav>

<hr>

<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

### Explanation:

- `<router-outlet>` is where the routed component will be injected.
- `<a routerLink="/about">About</a>` is a special directive that creates links without reloading the page.

---

## **Step 5: Verify the Setup**

Run the application:

```bash
ng serve
```

Now navigate to:
- `http://localhost:4200/` → HomeComponent
- `http://localhost:4200/about` → AboutComponent
- `http://localhost:4200/contact` → ContactComponent
- Invalid URLs will redirect to the homepage.

---

# **Configuring Routes with `RouterModule`**

The `RouterModule` is the module provided by Angular for routing-related features.

## **Key Configuration Options in `RouterModule.forRoot()`**

```ts
RouterModule.forRoot(routes, {
  enableTracing: false,         // Logs detailed routing events (useful for debugging)
  useHash: false,               // Enables hash-based URLs if true (e.g., /#/about)
  scrollPositionRestoration: 'enabled', // Scrolls to top on route change
  relativeLinkResolution: 'corrected'   // Resolves relative links
})
```

These options can help you manage scroll position, debugging, and link resolution in complex applications.

---

## **Adding Children Routes (Nested Routes)**

You can also create **nested routes** using the `children` property.

### Example:

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'courses',
    component: CoursesComponent,
    children: [
      { path: 'angular', component: AngularCourseComponent },
      { path: 'react', component: ReactCourseComponent }
    ]
  }
];
```

- Navigating to `/courses/angular` will load `CoursesComponent` with `AngularCourseComponent` rendered in a nested `<router-outlet>`.

---

## **Route Parameters**

You can pass dynamic parameters in URLs.

### Define the route:

```ts
{ path: 'student/:id', component: StudentComponent }
```

### Access the parameter inside the component:

```ts
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

ngOnInit() {
  const id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
}
```

Now visiting `/student/42` will give you access to the ID `42`.

---

## **Wildcard Routes and Redirects**

Wildcard (`**`) routes help handle non-existing paths.

```ts
{ path: '**', redirectTo: '', pathMatch: 'full' }
```

This ensures that any unknown route redirects to a default view, like a 404 page or home.

---

## **Separate Route Modules for Feature Modules**

In large applications, it’s a good practice to define routes **inside feature modules** instead of crowding the main `AppRoutingModule`.

Example:

- `CourseModule`
- `CourseRoutingModule`  
This keeps the routing **modular and maintainable**.

---

## **Common Routing Pitfalls**

- Not importing `RouterModule` in the AppModule
- Forgetting to add `<router-outlet>` in the main template
- Using regular `<a href="...">` instead of `routerLink`
- Mismatched paths and component references
- Not handling wildcard routes for invalid paths

---

## **Summary**

- Angular Routing allows dynamic component navigation without reloading the page.
- The `RouterModule` is the core Angular module that enables routing.
- Configuration is done in `app-routing.module.ts` using an array of route objects.
- Routing works by mapping paths to components, which are rendered in `<router-outlet>`.
- You can enhance routes with parameters, guards, lazy loading, and nested child routes.

---

# **Route Guards and Lazy Loading in Angular**

Angular applications can grow large and complex. To ensure security, performance, and proper user flow, Angular provides advanced routing features like **Route Guards** and **Lazy Loading**.

These features help in:

- Restricting access to routes based on user roles or login state
- Loading modules only when needed to improve performance

We’ll cover both in great depth below.

---

## **1. Route Guards in Angular**

### What Are Route Guards?

Route guards are interfaces provided by Angular to **control access** to specific routes. They allow or prevent navigation to and from certain routes **based on specific conditions**, such as authentication or roles.

---

### Types of Route Guards

| Guard | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `CanActivate` | Checks if a user can access a route |
| `CanActivateChild` | Checks if a user can access child routes |
| `CanDeactivate` | Checks if a user can leave a route/component |
| `Resolve` | Fetches data *before* the route activates |
| `CanLoad` | Checks if a module can be lazily loaded |

---

### Implementing a `CanActivate` Guard

#### Step 1: Generate a Guard

```bash
ng generate guard auth
```

This creates a guard file `auth.guard.ts`.

#### Step 2: Define Logic in the Guard

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivate, Router } from '@angular/router';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private router: Router) {}

  canActivate(): boolean {
    const isLoggedIn = localStorage.getItem('loggedIn') === 'true';
    if (!isLoggedIn) {
      this.router.navigate(['/login']);
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Apply Guard in Routes

```ts
{ path: 'dashboard', component: DashboardComponent, canActivate: [AuthGuard] }
```

---

### `CanDeactivate` Example

Use this when you want to **warn users before navigating away** from a form with unsaved changes.

#### Guard Implementation:

```ts
export interface CanComponentDeactivate {
  canDeactivate: () => boolean;
}

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class DeactivateGuard implements CanDeactivate<CanComponentDeactivate> {
  canDeactivate(component: CanComponentDeactivate): boolean {
    return component.canDeactivate ? component.canDeactivate() : true;
  }
}
```

#### In Component:

```ts
export class ProfileComponent implements CanComponentDeactivate {
  canDeactivate(): boolean {
    return confirm("You have unsaved changes. Are you sure you want to leave?");
  }
}
```

#### Route Configuration:

```ts
{ path: 'profile', component: ProfileComponent, canDeactivate: [DeactivateGuard] }
```

---

## **2. Lazy Loading in Angular**

### What is Lazy Loading?

Lazy loading is a technique where **feature modules are loaded only when they are required**, rather than loading everything upfront.

This helps with:

- Reducing **initial load time**
- Improving **performance** of large apps
- Organizing code into **feature-specific modules**

---

### How Lazy Loading Works in Angular

Angular uses the **dynamic import syntax** to lazy load modules. These modules are only loaded when the user navigates to a route associated with that module.

---

### Step-by-Step: Lazy Load a Module

#### Step 1: Create a Feature Module with Routing

```bash
ng generate module admin --route admin --module app.module
```

This automatically:
- Creates `admin.module.ts` and `admin-routing.module.ts`
- Configures lazy loading in `app-routing.module.ts`

#### Step 2: Structure of Admin Module (auto-generated)

**admin-routing.module.ts:**

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: AdminDashboardComponent }
];
```

**admin.module.ts:**

```ts
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AdminDashboardComponent],
  imports: [
    CommonModule,
    AdminRoutingModule
  ]
})
export class AdminModule { }
```

#### Step 3: Configure Lazy Load in `app-routing.module.ts`

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'admin',
    loadChildren: () =>
      import('./admin/admin.module').then(m => m.AdminModule)
  }
];
```

When a user visits `/admin`, Angular will dynamically load the **AdminModule**.

---

### Combining Lazy Loading with Guards

To **secure** lazy-loaded routes, use `canLoad`:

```ts
{
  path: 'admin',
  loadChildren: () => import('./admin/admin.module').then(m => m.AdminModule),
  canLoad: [AuthGuard]
}
```

Here, the `AuthGuard` will check **before** loading the module to ensure the user has permission.

---

## **Preloading Strategies**

Lazy loading improves performance, but some modules can also be **preloaded in the background** after the initial load, so they're available faster when needed.

Angular provides:

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NoPreloading` (default) | No modules are preloaded |
| `PreloadAllModules` | Preloads all lazy-loaded modules after app load |
| **Custom Strategy** | Write your own logic for preloading |

**Enable Preloading:**

```ts
RouterModule.forRoot(routes, { preloadingStrategy: PreloadAllModules })
```

---

## **Best Practices for Routing**

- Always use **feature modules** with routing.
- Apply **guards** on protected routes like dashboards, admin panels, etc.
- Use **lazy loading** for large sections of the application.
- Handle **404 routes** gracefully using wildcards.
- Keep route definitions **modular** and **scalable**.

---

## **Summary**

- Route Guards protect navigation using logic for login, role, or confirmation.
- Angular provides five guard types including `CanActivate`, `CanLoad`, and `CanDeactivate`.
- Lazy loading boosts performance by loading modules only when needed.
- Preloading strategies balance performance and responsiveness.
- Combining both helps create **fast**, **secure**, and **user-friendly** Angular applications.
