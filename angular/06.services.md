# **Introduction to Angular Services**

Angular Services are a core concept that help **organize and share business logic, data, and functions** across different components of an Angular application. They enable **separation of concerns**, keeping components focused only on their primary role — the view — while services handle non-UI logic such as **data retrieval, processing, state management, and communication with external systems**.

---

## **Why Angular Services Are Needed**

Angular applications grow in size and complexity over time. As more components are added, it becomes necessary to:

- Avoid duplicating code across components
- Share common functionality (e.g., authentication, data retrieval)
- Enable components to communicate indirectly via a shared service
- Maintain clean, maintainable, and reusable code
- Separate business logic from UI logic

---

## **What is an Angular Service?**

An Angular Service is a **TypeScript class** decorated with `@Injectable()` that provides **reusable functionality** throughout the application. Unlike components, services have no templates or views. They are designed to contain logic that can be **used across multiple components**.

---

## **Common Responsibilities of Services**

- Fetching data from REST APIs using HTTP
- Centralized state and data management
- Logging user activity
- Validating user input and transforming data
- Business logic implementation (e.g., calculations, condition-based workflows)
- Managing user authentication and authorization
- Managing browser storage (localStorage, sessionStorage)
- Utility functions (e.g., formatting dates, parsing text, etc.)

---

## **Structure of a Basic Angular Service**

A simple service consists of:

- A **TypeScript class**
- The `@Injectable()` decorator to make the service eligible for dependency injection
- Public methods that perform specific tasks

### **Example:**

#### Step 1: Creating a service

```bash
ng generate service student
```

This command creates two files:

```
student.service.ts
student.service.spec.ts (for unit testing)
```

#### Step 2: Defining the service logic

```ts
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root", // This registers the service globally
})
export class StudentService {
  private studentList = ["Mahir", "Yashvi", "Priyesha", "Arjun"];

  constructor() {}

  getStudents() {
    return this.studentList;
  }

  addStudent(name: string) {
    this.studentList.push(name);
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Using the service in a component

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { StudentService } from "./student.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-dashboard",
  template: `
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let student of students">{{ student }}</li>
    </ul>
  `,
})
export class DashboardComponent {
  students: string[] = [];

  constructor(private studentService: StudentService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.students = this.studentService.getStudents();
  }
}
```

## **Key Characteristics of Services**

- **Stateless by default**: Services do not store UI-specific state. If needed, you can manage application-wide state.
- **Singletons**: When provided in root, a service is a singleton. One instance is shared across the application.
- **Reusable**: You can inject the same service in any component, directive, or another service.
- **Testable**: Business logic in services is easier to test than logic mixed into components.

---

## **`@Injectable()` Decorator**

The `@Injectable()` decorator marks a class as available for **dependency injection**. It tells Angular how to create the service instance.

### Syntax:

```ts
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
```

- `providedIn: 'root'` makes the service available **application-wide**.
- This also ensures **tree-shaking**, so Angular can remove the service from the final build if it's not used anywhere.

---

## **Service Injection in Components**

Angular uses **Dependency Injection (DI)** to pass services to components automatically. This avoids manual instantiation and improves modularity.

### Steps:

- Declare the service in the constructor of the component
- Angular's DI system injects the singleton instance into the component

### Example:

```ts
constructor(private myService: MyService) {}
```

Now the component can use:

```ts
this.myService.someFunction();
```

---

## **Registering Services Manually**

Though using `providedIn: 'root'` is recommended, services can also be registered in a module manually:

### In a module (e.g., `app.module.ts`)

```ts
providers: [MyService];
```

This is useful when you want **limited scope** (e.g., different instances for different modules).

---

## **Real-World Examples of Angular Services**

- **StudentService**: Manage the list of enrolled students
- **AuthService**: Handle login/logout, manage user session
- **CourseService**: Fetch and update course data from the server
- **NotificationService**: Show toast messages across the app
- **LoggerService**: Log activities or errors to the console or server
- **StorageService**: Abstract localStorage and sessionStorage operations

---

## **Best Practices When Using Services**

- Keep services **focused on a single responsibility** (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Avoid storing **UI-specific state** inside services
- Prefer using **Observables or BehaviorSubjects** in services when working with asynchronous data
- Group **utility logic** (e.g., math functions, validators) into separate helper services
- Use services to **share data between unrelated components**

---

## **Benefits of Using Services in Angular**

- **Code Reusability**: One service can be used across multiple components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic remains independent of UI logic
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner and more organized codebase
- **Testability**: Unit testing business logic is easier when it's separated from components
- **Performance**: Since services are singletons, they conserve memory and improve performance

---

## **When Not to Use a Service**

While services are powerful, there are scenarios where they may be overkill:

- Avoid using services for simple, non-reusable logic that belongs solely to one component
- Do not store too much state in a singleton service unless you're building a state management layer

---

## **Conclusion**

Angular Services are the backbone of any medium to large Angular application. They offer a centralized place to manage logic, share data, and connect components to external systems. Mastering services is essential for building scalable, maintainable, and efficient Angular applications in the real world — including those built by students in the CodingGita program.
