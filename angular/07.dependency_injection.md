# **Dependency Injection**

Angular is built around **modularity and reusability**, and **Dependency Injection (DI)** is one of the core features that enables this. Dependency Injection allows different parts of your application to request the dependencies they need, without hardcoding how those dependencies are created or managed.

---

## **What is Dependency Injection (DI)?**

Dependency Injection is a **design pattern** in which objects are not responsible for creating their own dependencies. Instead, dependencies are provided to them externally. Angular uses a **hierarchical dependency injection system**, which makes it easy to provide and manage services at different levels of the application (e.g., app-wide, module-level, component-level).

---

## **Why Dependency Injection is Needed in Angular**

- **Loose coupling** between components and services
- Makes components easier to test and maintain
- Encourages reuse of services across components
- Centralized control over how services are created and managed
- Improves modularity of applications
- Makes mocking dependencies easy in unit testing

---

## **How Dependency Injection Works in Angular**

Angular uses its own **injector system** that maintains a registry of all available dependencies and provides them when required.

### The process involves:

1. **Registering a provider**: You make a service available to the injector using `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })` or inside the module/component `providers` array.

2. **Injecting the dependency**: Angular uses the **constructor of a class** to inject dependencies. It checks the type of the parameter and looks for a matching provider.

3. **Creating or retrieving the instance**: If the dependency has not been created yet, Angular creates it (singleton by default). If it already exists, it reuses the instance.

## **Core Concepts Involved**

| Concept      | Description                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Provider** | Defines how to create or retrieve a dependency                                 |
| **Injector** | Maintains a container of service instances                                     |
| **Token**    | A unique key used to identify a dependency (usually a class reference)         |
| **Scope**    | Determines how long the service instance lives (e.g., root, component, module) |

## **Registering a Service (Providing)**

There are two common ways to register a service so it can be injected:

### 1. **Using `providedIn` (Recommended)**

```ts
@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root", // Registers the service at the root level (singleton)
})
export class CourseService {
  // logic here
}
```

- This is the most common and preferred method.
- Ensures the service is available globally.
- Optimized by Angular using **Tree Shaking**.

### 2. **Using `providers` Array in a Module or Component**

```ts
@NgModule({
  providers: [CourseService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Or inside a component:

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-sample',
  templateUrl: './sample.component.html',
  providers: [LoggerService] // Creates a new instance scoped to this component
})
```

- Useful when different components need different instances of a service.

## **Creating a Custom Service**

### Step-by-Step Example

Suppose you want to create a service that manages a list of courses.

### 1. Generate the Service:

```bash
ng generate service course
```

This creates `course.service.ts` and its test file.

### 2. Define the Service:

```ts
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class CourseService {
  private courseList: string[] = ["Angular", "React", "Node.js"];

  constructor() {}

  getCourses(): string[] {
    return this.courseList;
  }

  addCourse(course: string): void {
    this.courseList.push(course);
  }
}
```

- `@Injectable()` marks this class as eligible for DI.
- `providedIn: 'root'` registers the service globally.
- The service has two functions: one for fetching courses and another for adding a new course.

---

## **Injecting a Service into a Component**

Once the service is registered, you can **inject it into any component** using the constructor.

### Example: Using `CourseService` in a Component

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { CourseService } from "./course.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-course-list",
  template: `
    <h2>Available Courses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let course of courses">{{ course }}</li>
    </ul>
  `,
})
export class CourseListComponent implements OnInit {
  courses: string[] = [];

  constructor(private courseService: CourseService) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.courses = this.courseService.getCourses();
  }
}
```

### Explanation:

- `CourseService` is injected into the component's constructor.
- Angular's DI system automatically finds the registered service and provides the instance.
- `ngOnInit()` is used to populate the component’s `courses` array using the service.

---

## **Singleton Nature of Services**

When a service is provided in `root`, Angular creates **one instance for the entire app**. This ensures:

- Efficient memory use
- Shared data across multiple components
- Consistent state throughout the app

However, you can override this behavior using `providers` at the component level, which creates a **new instance per component**.

---

## **Dependency Injection with Hierarchical Injectors**

Angular supports hierarchical injectors, which means:

- Each component can have its own injector
- Angular starts searching from the **component’s injector** and moves up the tree
- If a service is provided at the component level, it overrides the root provider for that component

This allows fine-grained control over service instances.

---

## **Injecting One Service into Another**

Angular also supports **service-to-service injection**. This is useful when you want to separate responsibilities further.

### Example:

```ts
@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class LoggerService {
  log(message: string): void {
    console.log("LOG:", message);
  }
}

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class EnrollmentService {
  constructor(private logger: LoggerService) {}

  enrollStudent(name: string): void {
    this.logger.log(`Enrolling student: ${name}`);
  }
}
```

---

## **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

- Not using `@Injectable()` on services will result in runtime errors.
- Avoid injecting services that are not provided in any module or root.
- Be cautious when registering services at component level — it creates **multiple instances** which may lead to inconsistent state.
- Do not tightly couple services; instead, design them to be **reusable and testable**.

---

## **Summary**

- Dependency Injection is a core Angular feature that improves modularity, testability, and maintainability.
- Services are registered using `@Injectable` and injected via constructors.
- Angular’s hierarchical DI system ensures fine control over the service lifecycle.
- Services are often used for logic and state management that should be shared across multiple components.
