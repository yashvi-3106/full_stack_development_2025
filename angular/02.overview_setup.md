# **Angular Overview and Setup**  

---

## Introduction

Angular is a complete front-end web application framework developed by Google. It uses TypeScript and enables the development of scalable, maintainable, and modular single-page applications (SPAs). Before working with Angular components and services, it's essential to understand the framework’s structure, how it is set up, and how the code is organized.

This article will cover:

- What is Angular?
- Installing Angular CLI
- Creating a new Angular project
- Project structure overview
- Understanding Angular architecture (Modules, Components, Services)

## What is Angular?

Angular is a platform for building client-side applications using TypeScript. It provides a set of tools, conventions, and features required to create full-fledged applications, including:

- Component-based UI development
- Routing and navigation between views
- Forms with validation
- API communication using HTTP
- Dependency Injection for service management
- Tools for testing, building, and deployment

Angular is suitable for both small and enterprise-scale projects and encourages clean, maintainable code through consistent structure.

## Installing Angular CLI

The Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is the official tool for initializing and managing Angular projects. It simplifies many tasks such as:

- Generating components, services, and modules
- Running local development servers
- Building optimized production code
- Running tests and linting code

### Prerequisites

Before installing Angular CLI, ensure the following are installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or above)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

### Installation Steps

Use the following command to install Angular CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

To verify the installation:

```bash
ng version
```

This will display the installed Angular CLI version and related dependencies.

---

## Creating a New Angular Project

Once the CLI is installed, create a new project using the following command:

```bash
ng new student-dashboard
```

During project creation, the CLI will prompt:

- Whether to use routing: `Yes`
- Style format: Choose one (`CSS`, `SCSS`, etc.)

After successful setup:

```bash
cd student-dashboard
ng serve
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Angular Project Structure Overview

When you open the project folder, the structure will look like this:

```
student-dashboard/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── app.component.ts
│   │   ├── app.component.html
│   │   ├── app.module.ts
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── environments/
├── angular.json
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
```

### Key Folders and Files

- **src/app/**: Contains the main application logic.
- **app.module.ts**: The root module that declares components and imports other modules.
- **app.component.ts / .html / .css**: The root component of the application.
- **angular.json**: Configuration file for Angular CLI.
- **package.json**: Lists dependencies and scripts.
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration file.

# **Understanding the Angular Architecture (Modules, Components, Services)**

Angular applications are structured using a modular architecture that promotes separation of concerns, reusability, and maintainability. At the heart of this architecture lie **Modules**, **Components**, and **Services** — three fundamental building blocks that define the structure, UI, and business logic of an Angular app.

We will now explore each in **complete detail**, with subtopics, examples, and internal mechanisms explained thoroughly.

---

## **1. Angular Modules**

### **What is a Module in Angular?**

A **Module** in Angular is a **container of a cohesive block of functionality**. It organizes related code such as components, directives, pipes, and services into a logical unit.

Every Angular app **must have at least one module**, which is the **root module**. But in most real-world applications, the app is divided into multiple **feature modules** for better organization and lazy loading.

### **TypeScript Class with @NgModule Decorator**

Modules are defined using a special decorator called `@NgModule`.

Here is what a simple module looks like:

```ts
// app.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],      // components, directives, pipes
  imports: [BrowserModule],          // external or feature modules
  providers: [],                     // services to inject
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]          // the root component to launch
})
export class AppModule { }
```

### **Key Properties of @NgModule**

| Property     | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `declarations` | Declares the components, directives, and pipes that belong to this module. |
| `imports` | Imports other modules whose exported classes are needed. |
| `providers` | Registers services for dependency injection. |
| `bootstrap` | Specifies the root component to bootstrap the application. |

### **Types of Modules**

- **Root Module**: The entry point (e.g., `AppModule`).
- **Feature Modules**: Group related features (e.g., `UserModule`, `ProductModule`).
- **Shared Module**: Contains common components, directives, and pipes reused across modules.
- **Core Module**: Contains singleton services used app-wide.

---

## **2. Angular Components**

### **What is a Component in Angular?**

A **Component** controls a part of the browser screen — a “view”. Angular applications are made by combining **multiple components**, each responsible for rendering a part of the UI and managing its logic.

In essence, a component is a **TypeScript class** that is decorated with `@Component`. It ties together:

- A **template** (HTML)
- A **class** (TS logic)
- An optional **style** (CSS/SCSS)

### **Basic Component Structure**

```ts
// student.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-student',
  templateUrl: './student.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./student.component.css']
})
export class StudentComponent {
  name: string = 'Priyesha';
  course: string = 'Angular Fundamentals';
}
```

```html
<!-- student.component.html -->
<h2>Welcome, {{ name }}</h2>
<p>You are enrolled in {{ course }}</p>
```

### **Component Lifecycle**

Each component has a **lifecycle**, managed by Angular. Some common lifecycle hooks:

- `ngOnInit()`: Called once after the component is initialized
- `ngOnChanges()`: Called when input-bound properties change
- `ngOnDestroy()`: Called before the component is destroyed

### **Component Metadata (@Component)**

| Property     | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `selector`   | The tag used in HTML to use this component (e.g., `<app-student>`). |
| `templateUrl`| Path to the HTML file |
| `styleUrls`  | Path to the CSS/SCSS file(s) |

### **Communication Between Components**

Angular provides multiple ways to pass data between components:

- **@Input()**: Pass data from parent to child
- **@Output()**: Emit events from child to parent
- **Services**: Share data across components via injection

### **Component Best Practices**

- Use clear file naming: `feature.component.ts`
- Keep component logic small, and offload complex operations to services
- Separate template, styles, and logic into dedicated files

---

## **3. Angular Services**

### **What is a Service in Angular?**

A **Service** is a reusable piece of logic or functionality that can be **injected** into multiple components or other services. Services typically handle:

- Data fetching via HTTP
- Business logic and calculations
- State management
- Utility functions

Services are defined as **classes**, and Angular uses **Dependency Injection** to provide them where needed.

### **Basic Service Example**

```ts
// student.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'   // ensures singleton service available app-wide
})
export class StudentService {
  getStudents() {
    return ['Jenil', 'Yashvi', 'Mahir', 'Arjun'];
  }
}
```

This service can now be injected into a component:

```ts
import { StudentService } from './student.service';

export class DashboardComponent {
  students: string[];

  constructor(private studentService: StudentService) {
    this.students = this.studentService.getStudents();
  }
}
```

### **Understanding @Injectable()**

The `@Injectable()` decorator marks a class as a service that can be managed by Angular’s DI system. Using `providedIn: 'root'` means Angular will create a **singleton** instance at the root level.

### **Service Scope**

| Scope             | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `providedIn: 'root'` | Available throughout the app |
| Provided in a module | Shared within that module only |
| Provided in a component | Unique instance per component instance |

### **Benefits of Using Services**

- Promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Encourages modular, testable code
- Simplifies state and data sharing across components

---

## **How These Pieces Work Together**

### **Architecture Flow**

1. The **AppModule** declares all the components and imports necessary modules.
2. Components form the **UI structure** of the application.
3. **Services** encapsulate logic and data and are injected into components using Angular's **DI system**.

For example, in a student dashboard:

- `AppModule` imports `StudentModule`
- `StudentComponent` displays the list of students
- `StudentService` fetches the data and provides it to the component

This separation of concerns improves **code organization**, **testing**, and **maintainability**.

---

## **Conclusion**

Understanding Angular’s core architecture — **Modules, Components, and Services** — is foundational for building structured, maintainable, and scalable applications.  

- **Modules** organize your application into cohesive units.
- **Components** handle view logic and UI.
- **Services** contain shared logic and data handling mechanisms.

This separation is what makes Angular powerful for building robust single-page applications (SPAs) with enterprise-level complexity.
