# Creating Angular Components

Angular applications are built using **components** — they are the **fundamental UI building blocks** that define what is rendered on the screen and how it behaves.

In this section, we'll explore everything you need to know about **creating Angular components**, how they work, and how to effectively use them within a real Angular project.

---

## **1. What is a Component in Angular?**

A **Component** in Angular controls a part of the user interface. It combines the **HTML template**, **CSS styles**, and **TypeScript logic** to display and manage a piece of the UI.

In simpler terms:

- **HTML** = what to show (view)
- **CSS** = how it looks (styles)
- **TS** = what it does (logic)

Each component is defined as a **TypeScript class**, decorated with the `@Component` decorator, which tells Angular that this class is a component.

---

## **2. How to Create a Component**

Angular provides two ways to create a component:

### **a. Manually Creating a Component**

You can create a component by manually creating:

- A `.ts` file for the component logic
- A `.html` file for the template
- A `.css` or `.scss` file for styling

Then, you must declare the component inside a module (`@NgModule` in `app.module.ts`).

Example:

```ts
// student.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-student',
  templateUrl: './student.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./student.component.css']
})
export class StudentComponent {
  studentName: string = 'Yashvi';
  course: string = 'Angular Fundamentals';
}
```

You must then create:
- `student.component.html` → UI template
- `student.component.css` → styles
- Register this in `AppModule` under `declarations`

### **b. Using Angular CLI (Recommended)**

The preferred way to create components is using the Angular CLI command:

```bash
ng generate component student
# or shorter:
ng g c student
```

This will automatically:
- Create the folder `src/app/student/`
- Add the 4 files:
  - `student.component.ts`
  - `student.component.html`
  - `student.component.css`
  - `student.component.spec.ts` (for testing)
- Register the component inside `AppModule` under `declarations`

## **3. Anatomy of a Component**

Each component consists of the following core parts:

### **a. The TypeScript Class (Logic Layer)**

Defines the component’s behavior and business logic.

Example:

```ts
export class StudentComponent {
  studentName: string = 'Priyesha';
  getWelcomeMessage() {
    return `Welcome, ${this.studentName}!`;
  }
}
```

### **b. The @Component Decorator (Metadata)**

Tells Angular how to use the component.

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-student',                  // tag name to use in HTML
  templateUrl: './student.component.html',  // location of HTML template
  styleUrls: ['./student.component.css']    // location of styles
})
```

### **c. The HTML Template (View Layer)**

This is what gets rendered in the browser.

```html
<!-- student.component.html -->
<h1>{{ studentName }}</h1>
<p>{{ getWelcomeMessage() }}</p>
```

### **d. The Styles (CSS/SCSS)**

Defines how the view looks.

```css
/* student.component.css */
h1 {
  color: darkblue;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

## **4. How to Use a Component in Another Component**

To use a component in another component (e.g., use `StudentComponent` inside `AppComponent`), you simply use the **selector** like a custom HTML tag.

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<h2>Main Dashboard</h2>
<app-student></app-student>
```

Angular knows how to render this because the `StudentComponent` is declared in the same module (`AppModule`).

---

## **5. Naming Conventions and Best Practices**

| Part | Convention |
|------|------------|
| File names | Use kebab-case: `student.component.ts` |
| Class names | Use PascalCase: `StudentComponent` |
| Selector names | Use `app-` prefix to avoid conflicts: `app-student` |
| Folder structure | Each component in its own folder under `/app/` |
| Logic | Keep business logic in services, not in components |

---

## **6. Component Tree and Hierarchy**

Angular supports **component nesting**, which helps build complex UIs by combining smaller components.

Example structure:

```
AppComponent
 └── DashboardComponent
     ├── StudentListComponent
     └── CourseDetailComponent
```

Each of these components has its own template and logic but can **communicate** with each other using:

- **@Input()** → pass data from parent to child
- **@Output()** → emit events from child to parent

---

## **7. Component Lifecycle (Advanced Concept)**

Angular components follow a **lifecycle**, managed by Angular itself. This includes:

| Hook           | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `ngOnInit()`   | Called once after component is initialized |
| `ngOnChanges()`| Called when input properties change |
| `ngOnDestroy()`| Called before component is removed |

Use these hooks to manage API calls, subscriptions, or DOM interactions.

---

## **8. Component Example in a Real Use-Case**

Suppose you're building a **Student Dashboard** in CodingGita’s internal platform.

You can create:

- `StudentCardComponent` → displays single student’s info
- `StudentListComponent` → lists all students
- `StudentDetailComponent` → shows details of selected student

Each of these will be a **self-contained Angular component**, and can be reused across pages.

## **9. Summary**

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Component | Core UI building block in Angular |
| Created using | `ng generate component` or manually |
| Includes | TS class, HTML template, and CSS style |
| Registered in | Angular module under `declarations` |
| Used via | Custom tag based on `selector` |
| Best Practice | Keep small, reusable, and logic-free components |
