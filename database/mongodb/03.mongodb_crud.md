### **Performing CRUD Operations in MongoDB**

CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—are fundamental for managing data in any database, and MongoDB is no different. This section will give you a deep dive into how you can perform these operations in MongoDB, exploring common patterns, best practices, and advanced usage. Using practical examples relevant to the **CodingGita BTech Computer Science Engineering program**, we’ll cover everything you need to master CRUD operations.

### **Create: Inserting Data into MongoDB**

The **Create** operation involves adding new documents to a MongoDB collection. MongoDB provides two primary methods for inserting documents: **insertOne()** and **insertMany()**.

#### **insertOne()**

The **insertOne()** method is used to insert a single document into a collection. Here's how we can insert a student into the `students` collection:

```javascript
db.students.insertOne({
  name: "Arjun",
  rollNumber: "12345",
  department: "CSE",
  year: 3,
  coursesEnrolled: ["Data Structures", "Algorithms", "DBMS"],
  age: 22,
  registrationDate: new Date()
});
```

**Explanation:**
- The `insertOne()` method inserts a document representing **Arjun**, a student enrolled in **year 3** of the **CSE department** at **CodingGita**.
- The document includes various fields, such as `name`, `rollNumber`, `department`, `year`, `coursesEnrolled`, and `age`. Additionally, we have a `registrationDate` field, which uses `new Date()` to store the date and time of the document's creation.

#### **insertMany()**

You can insert multiple documents at once using the **insertMany()** method. This is particularly useful when you have a batch of data to insert.

Example:

```javascript
db.students.insertMany([
  {
    name: "Mahir",
    rollNumber: "12346",
    department: "CSE",
    year: 2,
    coursesEnrolled: ["Mathematics", "DBMS", "OS"],
    age: 21,
    registrationDate: new Date()
  },
  {
    name: "Yashvi",
    rollNumber: "12347",
    department: "CSE",
    year: 2,
    coursesEnrolled: ["Networks", "Algorithms", "Maths"],
    age: 20,
    registrationDate: new Date()
  }
]);
```

**Explanation:**
- The **insertMany()** method inserts two documents for **Mahir** and **Yashvi** at the same time.
- This method is efficient when you need to insert multiple documents into a collection. It returns a result indicating how many documents were successfully inserted.

### **Read: Fetching Data from MongoDB**

The **Read** operation allows you to retrieve data stored in MongoDB. The two most common methods for fetching data are **find()** and **findOne()**.

#### **findOne()**

The **findOne()** method retrieves a single document from the collection. It returns the first document that matches the query condition.

Example: Fetching **Arjun’s** data from the `students` collection:

```javascript
db.students.findOne({ name: "Arjun" });
```

**Explanation:**
- The query `{ name: "Arjun" }` matches the document where the `name` field is **Arjun**.
- **findOne()** returns the first matching document.

#### **find()**

The **find()** method retrieves multiple documents that match a query condition. It can also be used with projections to limit the fields returned.

Example: Fetching all students in **year 2**:

```javascript
db.students.find({ year: 2 });
```

**Explanation:**
- This query will return all documents where the `year` field is **2**, i.e., all students in their second year.

#### **Using Projections**

Projections allow you to limit the fields returned in the query result. For instance, if you only want the `name` and `rollNumber` fields for students in **year 3**, use the following query:

```javascript
db.students.find({ year: 3 }, { name: 1, rollNumber: 1 });
```

**Explanation:**
- The `{ name: 1, rollNumber: 1 }` projection ensures that only the `name` and `rollNumber` fields are included in the result.

#### **Using Logical Operators**

MongoDB supports logical operators such as `$gt`, `$lt`, `$eq`, `$ne`, `$and`, `$or`, etc. These operators help to create complex queries.

Example: Fetching students who are either in **year 2** or have an **age** greater than 21:

```javascript
db.students.find({
  $or: [{ year: 2 }, { age: { $gt: 21 } }]
});
```

**Explanation:**
- The query returns all students who are either in **year 2** or are older than 21. The `$or` operator is used to combine the conditions.

#### **Sorting Data**

MongoDB allows you to sort the query results using the **sort()** method. Sorting can be done in ascending (1) or descending (-1) order.

Example: Fetching all students and sorting them by age in ascending order:

```javascript
db.students.find().sort({ age: 1 });
```

**Explanation:**
- The `{ age: 1 }` argument sorts the documents in ascending order of the `age` field.

#### **Pagination**

To paginate results, you can use the **limit()** and **skip()** methods. This is useful when working with large datasets.

Example: Fetching the first 10 students from the `students` collection:

```javascript
db.students.find().limit(10);
```

If you want to skip the first 10 records and fetch the next set, you can use **skip()**:

```javascript
db.students.find().skip(10).limit(10);
```

**Explanation:**
- **limit(10)** limits the number of documents returned to 10.
- **skip(10)** skips the first 10 documents and returns the next set of 10.

### **Update: Modifying Data in MongoDB**

The **Update** operation is used to modify existing documents in MongoDB. There are three main methods for updating data: **updateOne()**, **updateMany()**, and **replaceOne()**.

#### **updateOne()**

The **updateOne()** method updates a single document that matches the query condition. If no document matches, the operation does nothing.

Example: Updating **Mahir’s** department from **CSE** to **ECE**:

```javascript
db.students.updateOne(
  { name: "Mahir" },
  { $set: { department: "ECE" } }
);
```

**Explanation:**
- The query `{ name: "Mahir" }` finds the document representing **Mahir**.
- The `$set` operator updates the `department` field to **ECE**.

#### **updateMany()**

If you need to update multiple documents, use **updateMany()**. This method applies the update to all documents that match the query condition.

Example: Adding a `skills` field to all students in **year 2**:

```javascript
db.students.updateMany(
  { year: 2 },
  { $set: { skills: ["Java", "MongoDB", "Data Structures"] } }
);
```

**Explanation:**
- This command adds a new field `skills` with an array of skills to all students who are in **year 2**.

#### **replaceOne()**

The **replaceOne()** method replaces an entire document. If the document exists, it will be replaced with the new one provided.

Example: Replacing **Yashvi’s** entire record:

```javascript
db.students.replaceOne(
  { name: "Yashvi" },
  {
    name: "Yashvi",
    rollNumber: "12347",
    department: "CSE",
    year: 2,
    coursesEnrolled: ["AI", "ML", "Data Structures"],
    age: 20
  }
);
```

**Explanation:**
- The document of **Yashvi** is completely replaced with the new one provided. This is useful when you need to modify the entire document.

### **Delete: Removing Data from MongoDB**

The **Delete** operation is used to remove documents from a MongoDB collection. The two main methods for deleting documents are **deleteOne()** and **deleteMany()**.

#### **deleteOne()**

The **deleteOne()** method deletes a single document that matches the query condition.

Example: Deleting **Mahir’s** record:

```javascript
db.students.deleteOne({ name: "Mahir" });
```

**Explanation:**
- The query `{ name: "Mahir" }` matches the document for **Mahir**.
- **deleteOne()** deletes the first matching document.

#### **deleteMany()**

The **deleteMany()** method removes all documents that match the query condition.

Example: Deleting all students who are older than 25:

```javascript
db.students.deleteMany({ age: { $gt: 25 } });
```

**Explanation:**
- This will delete all students who are older than 25 from the `students` collection.

### **Best Practices for CRUD Operations**

- **Indexing**: For faster query performance, create indexes on frequently queried fields. For example, if you often search by `rollNumber`, create an index on that field.
  
  ```javascript
  db.students.createIndex({ rollNumber: 1 });
  ```

- **Atomic Operations**: MongoDB supports atomic operations for single documents, meaning that updates to a single document will be consistent and isolated.

- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors when performing CRUD operations to ensure smooth execution.

  ```javascript
  try {
    db.students.insertOne({ name: "Krishna", rollNumber: "12348" });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error inserting data:", error);
  }
  ```
