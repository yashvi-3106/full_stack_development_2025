### **First Assignment**

In this assignment, you will create a "CodingGita Students" database, featuring two collections: `students` and `subjects`. You will learn and practice various CRUD operations, as well as work with relationships between subjects and topics.

### **1. Create the Database and Collections**

Let’s start by creating a MongoDB database named `CodingGita` and two collections: `students` and `subjects`. You will also create sub-collections for topics related to each subject.

#### **Step 1: Create the Database**
```js
use codinggita  // Switch to the CodingGita database. If it doesn't exist, MongoDB will create it automatically.
```

#### **Step 2: Create the `students` collection**
```js
db.createCollection("students");
```

#### **Step 3: Create the `subjects` collection**
```js
db.createCollection("subjects");
```

At this point, you have created a new database with two collections.

---

### **2. Insert Sample Data**

Let’s insert some initial data into the `students` and `subjects` collections.

#### **Step 1: Insert sample data into the `students` collection**
```js
db.students.insertMany([
  { 
    "name": "Jenil",
    "rollNumber": 101,
    "department": "Computer Science",
    "year": 2,
    "subjectsEnrolled": ["React", "NodeJS", "MongoDB"]
  },
  { 
    "name": "Mahir",
    "rollNumber": 102,
    "department": "Computer Science",
    "year": 2,
    "subjectsEnrolled": ["React", "NodeJS"]
  },
  { 
    "name": "Arjun",
    "rollNumber": 103,
    "department": "Electrical Engineering",
    "year": 3,
    "subjectsEnrolled": ["Circuit Theory", "Electrical Machines"]
  }
]);
```

#### **Step 2: Insert sample data into the `subjects` collection**
```js
db.subjects.insertMany([
  { 
    "subjectName": "React",
    "topics": [
      "JSX", 
      "Components", 
      "State", 
      "Props", 
      "Hooks"
    ]
  },
  { 
    "subjectName": "NodeJS", 
    "topics": [
      "Modules", 
      "Express", 
      "File System", 
      "Asynchronous Programming"
    ]
  },
  { 
    "subjectName": "MongoDB", 
    "topics": [
      "Database Design", 
      "CRUD Operations", 
      "Aggregation", 
      "Indexes"
    ]
  }
]);
```

Now that the basic data is inserted into both collections, let's move on to querying the data.

---

### **3. Querying Data**

Now, we will query the database to retrieve information.

#### **Step 1: Query students based on department**
To find all students in the **Computer Science** department:
```js
db.students.find({ "department": "Computer Science" });
```

#### **Step 2: Query students based on year**
To find all students who are in **year 2**:
```js
db.students.find({ "year": 2 });
```

#### **Step 3: Query students by subject enrollment**
To find all students enrolled in the **React** subject:
```js
db.students.find({ "subjectsEnrolled": "React" });
```

#### **Step 4: Query subjects with a specific topic**
To find the subject which contains the topic **"Hooks"**:
```js
db.subjects.find({ "topics": "Hooks" });
```

---

### **4. Updating Data**

We will now update data using MongoDB's `updateOne` and `updateMany` methods.

#### **Step 1: Add a subject for a student**
Let’s add a subject, **MongoDB**, for **Mahir**:
```js
db.students.updateOne(
  { "name": "Mahir" },
  { $push: { "subjectsEnrolled": "MongoDB" } }
);
```

#### **Step 2: Update a student's year**
Suppose **Arjun** has moved to year 4. We can update his year:
```js
db.students.updateOne(
  { "name": "Arjun" },
  { $set: { "year": 4 } }
);
```

#### **Step 3: Add a new topic to a subject**
Let’s say we want to add a new topic, **"Advanced Hooks"**, to the **React** subject:
```js
db.subjects.updateOne(
  { "subjectName": "React" },
  { $push: { "topics": "Advanced Hooks" } }
);
```

---

### **5. Deleting Data**

Now, let’s delete some data.

#### **Step 1: Delete a student record**
To delete **Arjun's** record:
```js
db.students.deleteOne({ "name": "Arjun" });
```

#### **Step 2: Delete a subject from the `subjects` collection**
To delete the **MongoDB** subject:
```js
db.subjects.deleteOne({ "subjectName": "MongoDB" });
```

---

### **6. More Practice Tasks**

#### **Task 1: Add multiple students**
Insert at least **5 students** into the `students` collection with unique roll numbers, names, departments, years, and subjects enrolled.

#### **Task 2: Add multiple subjects**
Insert **4 subjects** into the `subjects` collection, each with 3 to 5 topics.

#### **Task 3: Query students based on subject enrollment**
Query the `students` collection to find all students who are enrolled in **NodeJS**.

#### **Task 4: Add a new topic to a subject**
Add a new topic to the **NodeJS** subject.

#### **Task 5: Query subjects with multiple topics**
Query the `subjects` collection to find subjects that contain **at least 4 topics**.

#### **Task 6: Update student enrollment**
Add the subject **"React Native"** to **Jenil's** subjects.

#### **Task 7: Query all students**
Query all students in the database and print out their names and enrolled subjects.

#### **Task 8: Update multiple students' year**
Update the year for all students in the **Computer Science** department to year 3.

#### **Task 9: Add new topics to multiple subjects**
Add new topics to **React**, **NodeJS**, and **MongoDB** subjects. Ensure each subject gets at least **one** new topic.

#### **Task 10: Remove a topic from a subject**
Remove the topic **"Express"** from the **NodeJS** subject.

#### **Task 11: Query all students in a specific year**
Query and return all students in **year 2** or **year 3**.

#### **Task 12: Delete a student by roll number**
Delete a student from the database using their **roll number**.

#### **Task 13: Delete all students from a department**
Delete all students who belong to the **Electrical Engineering** department.

#### **Task 14: Retrieve all topics for a subject**
Query the **MongoDB** subject and retrieve all topics listed for it.

#### **Task 15: Count the number of subjects in which a student is enrolled**
Write a query that returns the number of subjects each student is enrolled in.
