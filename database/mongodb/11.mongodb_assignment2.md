### Second Assignment on MongoDB: "CodingGita Students"

---

#### **Task 1: Create the "CodingGita Students" Database**

- **Step 1**: Create a new database called `"CodingGita Students"`.

  ```js
  use codinggitastudents;
  ```

- **Step 2**: Create two collections: `students` and `courses`.
  ```js
  db.createCollection("students");
  db.createCollection("courses");
  ```

#### **Task 2: Insert Sample Data into Collections**

1. **Inserting Data into the `students` Collection**  
   Add the following student records:

   ```js
   db.students.insertMany([
     {
       name: "Jenil",
       rollNumber: "CS1001",
       department: "CSE",
       year: 2,
       coursesEnrolled: ["CS101", "MATH202", "PHY101"],
     },
     {
       name: "Mahir",
       rollNumber: "CS1002",
       department: "IT",
       year: 1,
       coursesEnrolled: ["CS101", "MATH101"],
     },
     {
       name: "Arjun",
       rollNumber: "CS1003",
       department: "CSE",
       year: 3,
       coursesEnrolled: ["CS301", "MATH303"],
     },
     {
       name: "Yashvi",
       rollNumber: "CS1004",
       department: "ECE",
       year: 2,
       coursesEnrolled: ["ECE201", "MATH202"],
     },
   ]);
   ```

2. **Inserting Data into the `courses` Collection**  
   Add the following course records:
   ```js
   db.courses.insertMany([
     {
       courseCode: "CS101",
       name: "Introduction to Programming",
       credits: 3,
       instructor: "Prof. Krishna",
     },
     {
       courseCode: "MATH101",
       name: "Mathematics I",
       credits: 4,
       instructor: "Prof. Priyasha",
     },
     {
       courseCode: "PHY101",
       name: "Physics I",
       credits: 4,
       instructor: "Prof. Arjun",
     },
     {
       courseCode: "ECE201",
       name: "Digital Electronics",
       credits: 3,
       instructor: "Prof. Mahir",
     },
   ]);
   ```

---

#### **Task 3: Query Data from the Database**

1. **Basic Queries**

   - Fetch all students from the `"students"` collection:
     ```js
     db.students.find();
     ```
   - Fetch students enrolled in "CS101":
     ```js
     db.students.find({ coursesEnrolled: "CS101" });
     ```
   - Fetch students in the "CSE" department:
     ```js
     db.students.find({ department: "CSE" });
     ```

2. **Using Projections to Retrieve Specific Fields**

   - Fetch only the `name` and `department` of students:
     ```js
     db.students.find({}, { name: 1, department: 1 });
     ```

3. **Using Comparison Operators for Queries**

   - Fetch students from the 2nd year:
     ```js
     db.students.find({ year: { $eq: 2 } });
     ```
   - Fetch students enrolled in more than 3 courses:
     ```js
     db.students.find({ "coursesEnrolled.3": { $exists: true } });
     ```

4. **Using Logical Operators**
   - Fetch students from "CSE" or "ECE" department:
     ```js
     db.students.find({ $or: [{ department: "CSE" }, { department: "ECE" }] });
     ```

---

#### **Task 4: Update Data in the Collections**

1. **Update One Document**

   - Update Yashviâ€™s department to "CS" (from "ECE"):
     ```js
     db.students.updateOne({ name: "Yashvi" }, { $set: { department: "CS" } });
     ```

2. **Update Multiple Documents**

   - Update all students enrolled in "MATH101" to include "CS102" in their courses:
     ```js
     db.students.updateMany(
       { coursesEnrolled: "MATH101" },
       { $push: { coursesEnrolled: "CS102" } }
     );
     ```

3. **Update Nested Fields**
   - Change the instructor for the course "CS101":
     ```js
     db.courses.updateOne(
       { courseCode: "CS101" },
       { $set: { instructor: "Prof. Krishna Kumar" } }
     );
     ```

---

#### **Task 5: Delete Data from the Database**

1. **Delete One Document**

   - Delete a student with the roll number "CS1004" (Yashvi):
     ```js
     db.students.deleteOne({ rollNumber: "CS1004" });
     ```

2. **Delete Multiple Documents**
   - Delete all students who are in their 1st year:
     ```js
     db.students.deleteMany({ year: 1 });
     ```

---

#### **Task 6: Aggregation and Grouping Data**

1. **Count the Number of Students in Each Department**

   - Use aggregation to group students by department and count them:
     ```js
     db.students.aggregate([
       { $group: { _id: "$department", totalStudents: { $sum: 1 } } },
     ]);
     ```

2. **Average Number of Courses Enrolled by Students**
   - Use aggregation to find the average number of courses each student is enrolled in:
     ```js
     db.students.aggregate([
       { $project: { numCourses: { $size: "$coursesEnrolled" } } },
       { $group: { _id: null, avgCourses: { $avg: "$numCourses" } } },
     ]);
     ```

---

#### **Task 7: Advanced Querying and Indexing**

1. **Create an Index on the `rollNumber` Field**

   - Create an index on `rollNumber` to optimize search performance:
     ```js
     db.students.createIndex({ rollNumber: 1 });
     ```

2. **Search for Students Using Partial Text Matching**
   - Search students whose names start with "A":
     ```js
     db.students.find({ name: { $regex: "^A" } });
     ```

---

#### **Task 8: Backup and Restore Data**

1. **Backup Database**

   - Use `mongodump` to back up the database:
     ```bash
     mongodump --db CodingGitaStudents --out /path/to/backup
     ```

2. **Restore Database**
   - Use `mongorestore` to restore the database:
     ```bash
     mongorestore --db CodingGitaStudents /path/to/backup/CodingGitaStudents
     ```

---

### **Practice Assignment:**

**1. Additional Questions on CRUD Operations:**

- Insert new students into the `"students"` collection with random data.
- Update the department of a student based on their roll number.
- Remove all students who have enrolled in less than 3 courses.

**2. Aggregation Exercise:**

- Use aggregation to find the department with the most number of students.

**3. Advanced Querying Exercise:**

- Query students who have enrolled in a specific set of courses (e.g., `CS101` and `MATH101`).

**4. Indexing and Performance:**

- Experiment with creating indexes on various fields like `department`, `year`, etc., and measure the query performance using `explain()`.
