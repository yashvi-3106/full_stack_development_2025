# **Using Express.js to Create APIs**

Building an API can feel overwhelming at first, but Express.js simplifies the process significantly. In this article, we’ll take a deep dive into how Express.js can be used to create APIs step-by-step.

---

### **1. What is Express.js?**

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides a minimal yet powerful set of tools to build APIs, websites, and web applications. 

#### **Why use Express.js for APIs?**
1. **Ease of Use**: Its syntax is simple and developer-friendly.
2. **Routing**: Efficiently handles complex URL structures.
3. **Middleware Support**: Easily integrate tasks like authentication or error handling.
4. **Flexibility**: Works well with various databases and libraries.

### **2. Setting Up Express.js for API Development**

Before creating your first API, you need to set up Express.js.

#### **2.1 Prerequisites**
Make sure you have:
- Node.js installed (check using `node -v` in the terminal).
- npm installed (comes with Node.js, check using `npm -v`).

#### **2.2 Installing Express.js**
1. Create a new project folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir express-api
   cd express-api
   npm init -y
   ```
   This initializes a new Node.js project.

2. Install Express.js:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

#### **2.3 Basic Express.js Application**
Now, create a file named `app.js` in your project folder. Add the following code:
```javascript
const express = require('express'); // Import Express
const app = express(); // Initialize Express app

// Middleware to parse JSON data
app.use(express.json());

// Starting the server
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```
This code:
- Initializes an Express.js application.
- Sets up a basic JSON parser middleware.
- Starts a server on port `3000`.

Run the app using:
```bash
node app.js
```

### **3. Building a Basic API with Express.js**

#### **3.1 Understanding Routes**
In Express.js, routes are used to define endpoints for your API. Each route is associated with an HTTP method (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and a specific path.

##### **Example of a GET Route**
```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the CodingGita API!');
});
```

When a user visits `http://localhost:3000/` in their browser, this route sends back a "Welcome" message.

#### **3.2 Creating an API to Manage Students**
Let’s extend the application to manage a list of students.

##### **3.2.1 GET All Students**
```javascript
const students = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Priyasha' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Arjun' },
];

app.get('/students', (req, res) => {
  res.json(students);
});
```
- The `/students` route responds with a list of all students in JSON format.

##### **3.2.2 GET a Specific Student by ID**
```javascript
app.get('/students/:id', (req, res) => {
  const studentId = parseInt(req.params.id, 10); // Extract ID from the URL
  const student = students.find((s) => s.id === studentId);

  if (student) {
    res.json(student);
  } else {
    res.status(404).send('Student not found');
  }
});
```
- The `:id` in the route indicates a dynamic parameter.
- If the student exists, their data is returned; otherwise, a 404 error is sent.

##### **3.2.3 Testing Your API**
Use **Postman**, **curl**, or a browser to test the endpoints:
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/students` for all students.
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/students/1` for a specific student.

### **4. Adding More Features**

Once you’re comfortable with GET requests, you can expand your API with other methods like POST, PUT, and DELETE. These allow you to add, update, or remove data.

#### **4.1 Adding a New Student (POST Request)**
```javascript
app.post('/students', (req, res) => {
  const newStudent = req.body; // Get new student data from the request body
  students.push(newStudent); // Add the student to the array
  res.status(201).json(newStudent); // Respond with the added student
});
```
- Use Postman to send a POST request with a JSON body:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Yashvi"
  }
  ```

#### **4.2 Handling Edge Cases**
Always validate incoming data:
```javascript
app.post('/students', (req, res) => {
  const { id, name } = req.body;

  if (!id || !name) {
    return res.status(400).send('ID and Name are required');
  }

  students.push({ id, name });
  res.status(201).json({ id, name });
});
```

### **5. Structuring Your Code for Larger Projects**

For small apps, you can keep everything in a single file. But as your API grows, it’s better to structure your code:

#### **5.1 Create a Router for Students**
1. Create a `routes/students.js` file:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const router = express.Router();

   const students = [
     { id: 1, name: 'Priyasha' },
     { id: 2, name: 'Arjun' },
   ];

   router.get('/', (req, res) => res.json(students));
   module.exports = router;
   ```

2. Modify `app.js` to use the router:
   ```javascript
   const studentRoutes = require('./routes/students');
   app.use('/students', studentRoutes);
   ```

This separates the student logic from the main app, making it easier to maintain.
