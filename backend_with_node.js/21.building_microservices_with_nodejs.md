# Building Microservices with Node.js

Microservices architecture has gained immense popularity for its scalability, maintainability, and flexibility in building complex applications. Node.js, with its non-blocking I/O model and lightweight nature, is a great choice for developing microservices. This article covers two critical aspects of microservice development with Node.js:

1. **Creating independent services**
2. **Database per service pattern**

## 1. Creating Independent Services

A fundamental principle of microservices architecture is designing each service as an independent unit with its own responsibilities, data, and execution environment. This section explains how to create fully decoupled services using Node.js.

### **Key Characteristics of Independent Services**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service should handle a specific function, e.g., user authentication, order management, or inventory.
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be updated or replaced without affecting others.
- **Loosely Coupled Communication**: Services interact via APIs instead of direct dependencies.
- **Own Data Storage**: Each service manages its own database to prevent tight coupling.

### **Steps to Create Independent Microservices in Node.js**

#### **1. Set Up a Node.js Service**
Each microservice runs independently. Letâ€™s create a simple **User Service** using Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
    res.json([{ id: 1, name: 'Arjun' }, { id: 2, name: 'Yashvi' }]);
});

app.listen(3001, () => {
    console.log('User Service running on port 3001');
});
```

#### **2. Implement Service Discovery**
Instead of hardcoding service URLs, use **Service Discovery** tools like **Consul** or **Eureka** to dynamically locate services.

#### **3. Use an API Gateway**
An **API Gateway** centralizes requests, authentication, and rate limiting. Example with **Express Gateway**:

```json
{
  "http": {
    "port": 8080
  },
  "apiEndpoints": {
    "users": {
      "path": "/users"
    }
  },
  "policies": ["proxy"],
  "pipelines": {
    "default": {
      "apiEndpoints": ["users"],
      "policies": [
        {
          "proxy": {
            "action": {
              "serviceEndpoint": "user_service"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "serviceEndpoints": {
    "user_service": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3001"
    }
  }
}
```

#### **4. Secure Services with Authentication**
Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate requests between services.

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

function authenticateToken(req, res, next) {
    const token = req.header('Authorization');
    if (!token) return res.status(401).send('Access Denied');

    jwt.verify(token, 'SECRET_KEY', (err, user) => {
        if (err) return res.status(403).send('Invalid Token');
        req.user = user;
        next();
    });
}
```

## 2. Database Per Service Pattern

The **Database Per Service Pattern** ensures each microservice has its own database to avoid conflicts and dependencies.

### **Why Use This Pattern?**
- Prevents a **single point of failure**.
- Enables services to choose different **databases** suited to their needs (e.g., MongoDB for users, PostgreSQL for orders).
- Enhances **scalability** by distributing workloads.
- Avoids schema changes affecting multiple services.

### **Implementing Database Per Service**
Each service should interact with its own **database instance**.

#### **1. User Service - Using MongoDB**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/users', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ name: String });
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

#### **2. Order Service - Using PostgreSQL**
```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({
    user: 'postgres',
    host: 'localhost',
    database: 'orders',
    password: 'password',
    port: 5432,
});
```

#### **3. Inter-Service Communication (Event-Driven Approach)**
Since services have separate databases, use **message brokers** (e.g., **RabbitMQ, Kafka**) for data synchronization.

Example: **User Registration Event**
```javascript
const amqp = require('amqplib/callback_api');
amqp.connect('amqp://localhost', (err, connection) => {
    connection.createChannel((err, channel) => {
        const queue = 'user_created';
        const msg = JSON.stringify({ userId: 1, name: 'Arjun' });
        channel.sendToQueue(queue, Buffer.from(msg));
        console.log('User created event sent');
    });
});
```

The **Order Service** listens for this event:
```javascript
amqp.connect('amqp://localhost', (err, connection) => {
    connection.createChannel((err, channel) => {
        const queue = 'user_created';
        channel.consume(queue, (msg) => {
            console.log('Received:', msg.content.toString());
        }, { noAck: true });
    });
});
```

## **Best Practices for Microservices with Node.js**

1. **Use a Centralized Logging System** (e.g., **Winston, ELK stack**) for monitoring.
2. **Ensure Proper Error Handling** to avoid service crashes.
3. **Optimize Performance with Caching** (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
4. **Use API Gateways** for secure and scalable routing.
5. **Follow the Twelve-Factor App Methodology** to build scalable services.
6. **Adopt CI/CD Pipelines** (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) for automated deployments.
7. **Use Rate Limiting** (e.g., Express Rate Limit) to prevent abuse.

## **Conclusion**

Building microservices with Node.js allows teams to create scalable and maintainable applications. By ensuring **independence** of services and implementing the **database per service pattern**, developers can avoid tight coupling and scale their applications efficiently. Using tools like **RabbitMQ, API Gateways, JWT authentication**, and different database technologies further enhances flexibility and reliability.
