# Scaling Monolithic Applications

In the previous articles, we built a monolithic application step by step, starting with the **User Module**, adding the **Streaming Module** and **Payment Module**, and implementing session management and authentication. Now, let’s dive into **scaling monolithic applications** in the context of **JioHotstar**, a platform that handles millions of concurrent users during high-intensity IPL matches.

In this article, we’ll explore:
1. **The Challenges of High-Traffic Events** (e.g., IPL matches involving RCB, SRH, or MS Dhoni).
2. **Techniques for Scaling a Monolithic App**.
3. **Vertical Scaling vs Horizontal Scaling**.
4. **A Real-World Case Study: How JioHotstar Scales During IPL Matches**.

By the end of this article, you’ll have a comprehensive understanding of how to scale monolithic applications effectively, using JioHotstar and IPL as a relatable example.

## 1. The Challenges of High-Traffic Events

During high-intensity IPL matches, JioHotstar faces several challenges:
- **Millions of Concurrent Users**: Matches involving popular teams like **RCB** (Royal Challengers Bangalore) or players like **MS Dhoni** attract millions of viewers simultaneously.
- **Peak Traffic Spikes**: Traffic spikes occur during key moments, such as the first ball, last over, or when a star player comes to bat.
- **High Resource Usage**: Streaming live video consumes significant bandwidth, CPU, and memory.
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Slow response times or crashes can lead to a poor user experience and loss of revenue.

To handle these challenges, JioHotstar must scale its monolithic application effectively. Let’s explore how this is done.

## 2. Techniques for Scaling a Monolithic App

Scaling a monolithic application like JioHotstar requires a combination of techniques. Here’s how JioHotstar tackles the challenges:

### a) **Optimize Code and Database Queries**
Before scaling infrastructure, optimize the application code and database queries to improve performance.

#### Example:
- **Reduce Redundant Computations**: Avoid unnecessary calculations or loops in the code.
- **Optimize Database Queries**: Use indexes, avoid `SELECT *`, and optimize joins.
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple database queries in batches to reduce load.

For JioHotstar:
- Optimize queries for fetching live stream URLs, match schedules, and user profiles.
- Use efficient algorithms for generating personalized recommendations.

### b) **Implement Caching**
Caching stores frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need to fetch it from the database repeatedly. Use tools like **Redis** or **Memcached** for caching.

#### Example:
- **Cache Live Stream URLs**: Store live stream URLs in Redis to reduce database queries during peak traffic.
- **Cache Match Metadata**: Cache match schedules, scores, and player statistics.

For JioHotstar:
```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

// Cache match details
app.get('/matches/:id', (req, res) => {
  const matchId = req.params.id;

  // Check cache first
  client.get(`match:${matchId}`, (err, data) => {
    if (data) {
      return res.json({ match: JSON.parse(data) });
    }

    // Fetch from database if not in cache
    Match.findById(matchId, (err, match) => {
      if (match) {
        // Store in cache for future requests
        client.setex(`match:${matchId}`, 3600, JSON.stringify(match));
        res.json({ match });
      } else {
        res.status(404).json({ message: 'Match not found' });
      }
    });
  });
});
```

### c) **Use a Load Balancer**
A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the application. This ensures no single server is overwhelmed and improves availability.

#### Example:
- Use **Nginx** or **HAProxy** as a load balancer for JioHotstar.
- Distribute traffic across multiple servers during high-profile matches.

For JioHotstar:
- Deploy multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer.
- Use health checks to ensure all instances are running smoothly.

### d) **Database Scaling**
If the application is database-bound, scale the database to handle more requests. Techniques include:
- **Replication**: Create read replicas to distribute read queries.
- **Sharding**: Partition data across multiple databases to distribute the load.

#### Example:
- Use database replication to handle read-heavy operations like fetching match schedules or user profiles.
- Shard user data across multiple databases based on regions or user IDs.

For JioHotstar:
- Replicate the database to handle read queries during peak traffic.
- Shard user data to distribute the load evenly.

### e) **Asynchronous Processing**
Offload long-running or resource-intensive tasks to background workers. Use message queues like **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka** to handle tasks asynchronously.

#### Example:
- Process payment transactions asynchronously to avoid blocking the main application.
- Generate personalized recommendations in the background.

For JioHotstar:
- Use RabbitMQ to process payment transactions and generate recommendations.
- Ensure the main application remains responsive during peak traffic.

## 3. Vertical Scaling vs Horizontal Scaling

When scaling a monolithic application, you have two primary options: **vertical scaling** and **horizontal scaling**. Let’s compare them in detail.

### a) **Vertical Scaling**
Vertical scaling involves increasing the resources (CPU, RAM, storage) of the existing server.

#### Advantages:
- **Simplicity**: No changes to the application architecture are required.
- **No Code Changes**: The application runs on a single server, so no modifications are needed.
- **Cost-Effective for Small Applications**: Suitable for applications with predictable traffic.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Limited Scalability**: There’s a limit to how much you can scale vertically (e.g., maximum CPU or RAM capacity).
- **Single Point of Failure**: If the server goes down, the entire application becomes unavailable.

#### Example:
For JioHotstar, vertical scaling might involve upgrading the server from 8GB RAM to 32GB RAM to handle more concurrent users during a cricket match.

### b) **Horizontal Scaling**
Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers to distribute the load. This requires running multiple instances of the application and using a load balancer.

#### Advantages:
- **High Scalability**: You can add as many servers as needed to handle increased traffic.
- **Fault Tolerance**: If one server fails, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining servers.
- **Better Performance**: Distributes the load evenly across multiple servers.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Complexity**: Requires setting up a load balancer and managing multiple servers.
- **Cost**: Running multiple servers can be more expensive than upgrading a single server.

#### Example:
For JioHotstar, horizontal scaling might involve deploying multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer to handle millions of users during the IPL final.

Let’s see how JioHotstar scales its monolithic application during high-intensity IPL matches:

### a) **Optimize Code and Database Queries**
- Cache live stream URLs and match metadata to reduce database queries.
- Optimize database queries for fetching user profiles and subscription details.

### b) **Implement Caching**
- Use Redis to cache frequently accessed data like match schedules and user preferences.

### c) **Use a Load Balancer**
- Deploy multiple instances of the application behind an Nginx load balancer to distribute traffic during high-profile matches.

### d) **Database Scaling**
- Use database replication to handle read-heavy operations like fetching match schedules.
- Shard user data across multiple databases to distribute the load.

### e) **Asynchronous Processing**
- Process payment transactions and generate personalized recommendations asynchronously using RabbitMQ.

### f) **Horizontal Scaling**
- Deploy multiple instances of the application to handle millions of concurrent users during live events like the IPL final.

## 5. Conclusion

Scaling a monolithic application is challenging but achievable with the right techniques. By optimizing code, implementing caching, using a load balancer, and scaling your database, you can handle increased traffic and improve performance. Choosing between vertical and horizontal scaling depends on your application’s specific needs, and in some cases, a combination of both strategies might be the best approach.

For applications like **JioHotstar**, scaling is critical to ensure a seamless user experience during high-traffic events like live cricket matches. By following the techniques discussed in this article, you can build a scalable and reliable monolithic application.
