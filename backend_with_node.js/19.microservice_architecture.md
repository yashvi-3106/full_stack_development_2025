# **What Are Microservices?**  

In our previous articles, we explored **monolithic architecture**, its scalability challenges, and how businesses like **JioHotstar and Netflix** handle high traffic. As applications grow, monolithic systems become harder to scale, maintain, and deploy efficiently. This is where **microservices architecture** comes into play.  

Microservices have transformed how modern applications are built, enabling better scalability, independent deployments, and flexibility in choosing technologies for different parts of a system.

## **1. Microservices vs. Monolithic Architecture**  

A **monolithic application** is a single, unified system where all functionalities‚Äîsuch as **user authentication, streaming, payments, recommendations, and ads**‚Äîexist in one codebase and are deployed together as a single unit.  

A **microservices architecture**, on the other hand, splits an application into **small, independent services**, each handling a specific function and communicating with other services via **APIs**.  

### **Key Differences Between Monolith and Microservices**  

| Feature          | Monolithic Architecture  | Microservices Architecture |
|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Structure**   | A single large codebase | Multiple smaller services |
| **Scalability** | Entire application scales together | Each service scales independently |
| **Deployment**  | The whole system is deployed at once | Services are deployed separately |
| **Technology**  | Uses a single stack (e.g., Java, MySQL) | Each service can use different technologies |
| **Maintenance** | Becomes harder as the codebase grows | Easier as each service is independent |
| **Fault Isolation** | A bug in one module can crash the whole system | A bug in one service does not impact others |
| **Development Speed** | Slower for large teams due to dependencies | Faster since teams work independently |

### **Example: JioHotstar Streaming Service**  

#### **Monolithic Approach**  
If JioHotstar were monolithic, the entire application‚Äîincluding **user authentication, video streaming, payments, recommendations, and ads**‚Äîwould be built as a single, tightly coupled system. Any update, such as fixing a payments bug, would require redeploying the entire platform.  

#### **Microservices Approach**  
By adopting microservices, JioHotstar can separate its system into **independent services**, such as:  
- **User Service** ‚Üí Handles authentication and user profiles  
- **Streaming Service** ‚Üí Manages video playback and quality  
- **Payments Service** ‚Üí Handles subscriptions and transactions  
- **Recommendation Service** ‚Üí Personalizes content based on viewing history  
- **Ads Service** ‚Üí Manages advertisements  

Each service runs separately, reducing system downtime and making development more efficient.

## **2. Benefits of Microservices**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Independent Scalability**  
Each microservice scales individually, allowing efficient resource usage.  

‚úÖ **Example:**  
During the IPL, only the **Streaming Service** needs scaling, whereas the **Payments Service** does not require additional resources.  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Faster Development & Deployment**  
Teams can develop and deploy microservices independently.  

‚úÖ **Example:**  
The **Payments team** can update payment gateways without affecting the **Streaming Service**.  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Improved Fault Isolation**  
A failure in one microservice does not bring down the entire system.  

‚úÖ **Example:**  
If the **Ads Service** crashes, the **video streaming experience remains unaffected**.  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Technology Flexibility**  
Each service can use the best-suited programming language and database.  

‚úÖ **Example:**  
- **Streaming Service** ‚Üí Uses **Node.js & MongoDB**  
- **Payments Service** ‚Üí Uses **Java & PostgreSQL**  

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Easier Maintenance & Faster Bug Fixes**  
Bugs and updates are easier to manage without affecting the whole application.  

‚úÖ **Example:**  
A security update in **Payments Service** does not require redeploying the entire system.  

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Better Security & Compliance**  
Sensitive services like **Payments** can have stricter security policies.  

‚úÖ **Example:**  
The **Payments Service** can comply with **PCI DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) without affecting other services.  

---

## **3. Challenges of Microservices**  

Despite the benefits, microservices introduce new complexities.  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Increased System Complexity**  
With multiple services communicating over APIs, managing dependencies becomes harder.  

‚ùå **Example:**  
The **User Service** must communicate with the **Payments Service** to verify active subscriptions.  

‚úÖ **Solution:**  
Use **API Gateway** tools like **Kong or NGINX** to manage communication efficiently.  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Management & Consistency**  
Each microservice has its own database, making data consistency harder.  

‚ùå **Example:**  
If a user purchases a premium subscription, the **Streaming Service** must be updated to allow access.  

‚úÖ **Solution:**  
Use **event-driven architecture** (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for real-time updates.  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Overhead**  
Managing multiple services requires **orchestration tools** like Kubernetes.  

‚úÖ **Solution:**  
Use **Docker & Kubernetes** for containerized deployments.  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Debugging & Monitoring**  
Finding the root cause of failures is difficult across multiple services.  

‚úÖ **Solution:**  
Use **centralized logging tools** like **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **Jaeger for distributed tracing**.  

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Network Latency & API Overhead**  
Each service communicates via API calls, increasing latency.  

‚úÖ **Solution:**  
Use **gRPC** instead of REST APIs for faster communication.

## **5. When Should You Migrate to Microservices?**  

‚úÖ **1. Your monolithic app struggles under high traffic.**  
‚úÖ **2. Your development team is too slow due to code dependencies.**  
‚úÖ **3. You need different tech stacks for different features.**  
‚úÖ **4. Deployment and debugging become increasingly difficult.**  

---

## **Conclusion**  

Microservices offer **scalability, flexibility, and fault isolation**, making them essential for modern web applications like **JioHotstar, Netflix, and Amazon**. However, they also introduce **complexity, network latency, and debugging challenges**.  

If your application is small, **a monolithic approach is fine**. But as traffic grows, microservices **allow better scaling, independent deployments, and improved resilience**.
