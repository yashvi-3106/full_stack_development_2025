## **SECTION A: Core Database and Collection Operations**

1. Create a database named `students`.
2. Create a collection named `courses`.
3. Insert a single document into the `students` collection.
4. Insert multiple documents into the `students` collection.
5. Find all documents in a collection.
6. Find a document with a specific field value.
7. Find documents using `$and`, `$or`, `$not`, `$in`, `$nin`.
8. Find documents using comparison operators (`$gt`, `$lt`, `$gte`, `$lte`).
9. Use projection to fetch only selected fields.
10. Count the number of documents in a collection.
11. Sort documents based on a field.
12. Limit and skip results in a query.
13. Update one field in one document.
14. Update multiple documents using a condition.
15. Use `$inc`, `$set`, `$unset` in update queries.
16. Delete a single document.
17. Delete multiple documents using a condition.
18. Drop a collection.
19. Drop a database.
20. List all collections in the current database.

## **SECTION B: Data Modeling & Relationships**

21. Design a one-to-many relationship using embedded documents.
22. Design a one-to-many relationship using references.
23. Design a many-to-many relationship with references.
24. Choose between embedding and referencing with explanation.
25. Use `.populate()` (optional, if using Mongoose) or `$lookup` for joins.

## **SECTION C: Aggregation Framework**

26. Use `$group` to count how many students are in each course.
27. Use `$avg` to calculate the average marks of students.
28. Use `$sum` to find total marks scored per course.
29. Use `$match` to filter documents before aggregation.
30. Use `$sort` to sort results of an aggregation.
31. Use `$project` to reshape documents in aggregation.
32. Use `$limit` and `$skip` inside an aggregation pipeline.
33. Use `$lookup` to perform a join between `students` and `courses`.
34. Use `$unwind` to flatten an array field during aggregation.

## **SECTION D: Indexing and Performance**

35. Create a single-field index on `email`.
36. Create a compound index on `course` and `age`.
37. Create a unique index on `rollNo`.
38. Create a descending index on `createdAt`.
39. Create a partial index on `status = "active"`.
40. Create a TTL (Time To Live) index on `createdAt` that expires after 1 hour.
41. Use `.explain()` to analyze a queryâ€™s performance.
42. View all indexes in a collection.
43. Drop a specific index.
44. Drop all indexes in a collection.

## **SECTION E: Advanced Queries and Features**

45. Use `$regex` to perform case-insensitive search on names.
46. Create a text index on `bio` field and perform text search.
47. Use `$text` with `$search`, `$language`, and `$caseSensitive`.
48. Perform geospatial queries with `$near`, `$geoWithin` (if lat/lng is used).
49. Use array operators like `$elemMatch`, `$size`, `$all`.
50. Query documents where an array contains a specific value.

## **SECTION F: Backup and Restore (Shell-Based)**

51. Use `mongodump` to back up a single database.
52. Use `mongodump` to back up all databases.
53. Back up only one collection from a database.
54. Restore a database from its backup using `mongorestore`.
55. Restore all databases from a full backup.
56. Restore a single collection from backup.

---

## **SECTION G: Administrative and Shell Commands**

57. Show current database with `db`.
58. Switch to another database using `use`.
59. View MongoDB server status.
60. View stats of a specific collection using `db.collection.stats()`.
61. Check version of MongoDB server.
62. Check current user and roles (if auth is enabled).
63. Create a capped collection.
64. Convert an existing collection to capped.
65. Create a collection with schema validation.
